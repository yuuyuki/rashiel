<0000> May 10th Nozomi Route
<0001> Finally, Nozomi is handed over to Takami.
<0002> The morning of the day of farewell arrived.
<0003> Rei was feeling very depressed,
<0004> They head to the room where Takami is waiting to pick up Nozomi.
<0005> \{[Takami]}
<0006> "--Hey, Rei! You're really slow!
<0007> \ I'm tired of waiting!
<0008> \{[Takami]}
<0009> "Well then, let me take you there right away.
<0010> \ --Hey, someone! Bring Nozomi here!
<0011> After a while,
<0012> Nozomi appeared accompanied by a security guard.
<0013> Without showing the slightest sign of resistance,
<0014> Nozomi quietly raised her face, which was stiff with tension, and looked at Rei.
<0015> His eyes were calm.
<0016> He doesn't seem to blame Rei for not trying to help him.
<0017> He maintains a calm and composed gaze and remains silent.
<0018> \{[Takami]}
<0019> "Do you guys have anything to talk about?
<0020> \ This is your last chance to say goodbye.
<0021> \ If there's anything you want to say, say it now.
<0022> \{[Takami]}
<0023> "Nozomi, how about you? Thank you to the master who took care of me.
<0024> Is there anything you want to say?
<0025> \{[Hope]}
<0026> "Umm... Thank you for your help, Rei-san..."
<0027> \{[Hope]}
<0028> "Until today... you have been kind to me,
<0029> \ Thank you so much..."
<0030> \{[Hope]}
<0031> "Thank you for your kindness,
<0032> \ I will never... forget it.
<0033> \{[Takami]}
<0034> "...What, those are some very brave words.
<0035> \ Rei, what about you?
<0036> \{[Rei]}
<0037> "......"
<0038> What can I say now to Rei, who has abandoned Nozomi?
<0039> No words of apology, no words of repentance,
<0040> Everything feels empty.
<0041> I can't find the words to say,
<0042> In the end, Rei remained silent and was unable to say anything to Nozomi.
<0043> \{[Takami]}
<0044> "What, you're not going to say anything?
<0045> \ What a heartless guy..."
<0046> \{[Rei]}
<0047> "......"
<0048> \{[Takami]}
<0049> "Well, whatever. Come on, let's go, Nozomi."
<0050> \{[Nozomi]}
<0051> "Yes. I hope you're well, Rei-san..."
<0052> \{[Takami]}
<0053> "Oh wait. Before you leave the mansion,
<0054> \ I need to disable the mechanism around its neck..."
<0055> He took out a tiny cylindrical key from his pocket,
<0056> Takami inserts his finger into the small hole in the collar that has been binding Nozomi.
<0057> A faint electronic click sounded,
<0058> Nozomi's collar is finally removed.
<0059> The fact that the shackles that had bound Nozomi to the mansion had been removed
<0060> It does not mean the release of captives,
<0061> Furtherーdeeper bondage,
<0062> It was ironic that it became a symbol of hope.
<0063> \{[Takami]}
<0064> "Well then, sorry for interrupting, Rei.
<0065> \ I'll take Nozomi with me, but you'll still be staying at the mansion.
<0066> \ I'd like to entrust you with another product.
<0067> \{[Takami]}
<0068> "Once you hand over Nozomi to the Customer, she will come again.
<0069> \ Until then, don't go home on your own, okay?
<0070> \{[Rei]}
<0071> "......"
<0072> Takami entrusts the new product to Rei again,
<0073> It seems they intend to repeat the same attempt,
<0074> I don't feel like hanging out with him at all.
<0075> Rei decided to leave the mansion before Takami's next visit.
<0076> The guilt of abandoning them,
<0077> I couldn't bring myself to meet Nozomi's gaze.
<0078> Rei walked behind Nozomi in silence the whole time.
<0079> He was taken into a black car, and as if to cut ties with Rei,
<0080> At that moment, the door slammed shut with a heavy bang.
<0081> Finally, Rei took the plunge and looked at Nozomi's face.
<0082> When my eyes meet Rei's, she looks a little lonely,
<0083> With a smile that showed no trace of resentment,
<0084> Nozomi smiled back at Rei.
<0085> A strong wave of shock hits Rei's heart.
<0086> I was worried that I had made an irreparable mistake.
<0087> A chill runs down my spine.
<0088> \{[Rei]}
<0089> “Nozomi…”
<0090> My hand reached out without thinking,
<0091> Through the thick, distant glass, before touching Nozomi's fingers,
<0092> --The car starts moving.
<0093> \{[Rei]}
<0094> “Nozomi…!”
<0095> Nozomi's lips trembled slightly as she tried to say something,
<0096> The voices we make do not reach each other.
<0097> A cold wave of deep regret washed over my heart,
<0098> There is no way for Rei to stop this fate that has begun to unfold.
<0099> He took Nozomi away from the mansion,
<0100> The shadow of the car receded into the distance and eventually disappeared from view.
<0101> Rei just stood there and watched them leave.
<0102> Shortly after handing over Nozomi,
<0103> Rei left the mansion and returned to the house where she lived alone.
<0104> Takami tries to get Rei to return to the mansion.
<0105> I've contacted you many times,
<0106> Rei had no intention of going along with Takami's plan anymore,
<0107> I continued to coldly decline the invitation.
<0108> Just like before I went to the mansion,
<0109> Those boring, frustratingly tiring days,
<0110> Rei is back to her daily life.
<0111> \{[Takami]}
<0112> “--See you, Rei.
<0113> \ Whenever you feel like it, just let me know.
<0114> \ I'm waiting to hear from you.
<0115> \{[Rei]}
<0116> "...You're pretty persistent too.
<0117> \ Even if you persist, I won't be interested.
<0118> \ Give up quickly."
<0119> After hanging up the phone with Takami, Rei lets out a heavy sigh.
<0120> The memories of those few days spent at the mansion,
<0121> Although Rei wishes to erase it,
<0122> Because of Takami's repeated invitations,
<0123> I can't just bury it as a memory.
<0124> Takami's phone call reminded me of
<0125> The look Nozomi gave me on the day we parted.
<0126> I told myself to forget it quickly,
<0127> Rei shook her head vigorously to clear away her doubts.
<0128> I woke up to the sound of birds chirping cheerfully to each other,
<0129> There was a scene there that was different from any other morning.
<0130> \{[Rei]}
<0131> (Is this... Nozomi's room?)
<0132> This view is the next most familiar to me after my room.
<0133> It belonged to the room where Nozomi lived.
<0134> I suddenly felt a weight on my arm and looked next to me.
<0135> Nozomi rested her head on Rei's arm,
<0136> He was sleeping soundly and peacefully.
<0137> I gave him a light peck on the cheek,
<0138> He looks as exhausted as cotton and shows no signs of waking up.
<0139> \{[Rei]}
<0140> (…………)
<0141> Thinking back, last night was the first time I met Nozomi.
<0142> I got carried away halfway through and ended up doing something foolish.
<0143> When I saw the little body sleeping wrapped in the sheets,
<0144> The cherry blossom-colored marks that Rei had left are scattered all over his skin.
<0145> It shows that a very passionate exchange of love took place.
<0146> The number of traces of kisses that were left behind.
<0147> \{[Rei]}
<0148> (...I guess I pushed him too hard.)
<0149> By uniting body and mind,
<0150> To know such joy and such a sense of fulfillment,
<0151> It was the first time I had met someone like that.
<0152> It was as if Rei was experiencing it for the first time.
<0153> I was so absorbed in touching Nozomi that I lost the time to care for her.
<0154> \{[Rei]}
<0155> "I'm sorry, Nozomi..."
<0156> Feeling sorry, he opened his heart to Rei and leaned on her.
<0157> When I stroked her soft hair,
<0158> Nozomi's expression relaxes in comfort.
<0159> Rei hopes that this will be the least she can do to make amends, and that Nozomi will be completely healed from her fatigue.
<0160> Until it's time to wake up comfortably,
<0161> I stayed by his side, protecting his peaceful sleep.
<0162> \{[Rei]}
<0163> (Ahh -- I see. Last night, I visited Nozomi's room,
<0164> \ I talked to Nozomi to try to ease her tension.
<0165> \ I guess I just fell asleep...)
<0166> I felt some movement and turned my gaze to my side,
<0167> Nozomi lay face down,
<0168> With a look of amusement on his face, he begins to stroke Rei's hair.
<0169> Like a mother comforting her child,
<0170> A gentle touch.
<0171> The comfort of your hands as you slowly touch it
<0172> I almost fell asleep.
<0173> After enjoying the gentle touch in silence for a while,
<0174> Rei called out to Nozomi.
<0175> \{[Rei]}
<0176> "...What are you doing, Nozomi?"
<0177> \{[Hope]}
<0178> "What...?
<0179> \ Rei-san, are you awake?
<0180> \{[Rei]}
<0181> "Just now.
<0182> \ By the way, what were you doing?
<0183> \{[Hope]}
<0184> "Um, well! That's..."
<0185> I looked at Nozomi's face as she flinched and pulled away.
<0186> Her cheeks quickly turned red.
<0187> \{[Hope]}
<0188> "Um... it's the first time I've seen Rei-san's sleeping face,
<0189> \ I feel so happy..."
<0190> \{[Hope]}
<0191> "So... I've been watching."
<0192> \{[Rei]}
<0193> "You weren't just watching, were you...?"
<0194> \{[Hope]}
<0195> "Ah..."
<0196> \{[Hope]}
<0197> "...It's the first time I've had Rei's head this close to me.
<0198> I wanted to try touching it...
<0199> \{[Hope]}
<0200> "I'm sorry...!"
<0201> \{[Rei]}
<0202> "There's nothing to apologize for.
<0203> \ Because it felt so... good."
<0204> \{[Rei]}
<0205> "Could you do that again...?"
<0206> \{[Hope]}
<0207> "Y-yes!"
<0208> \{[Hope]}
<0209> "Ah...!"
<0210> \{[Rei]}
<0211> "...What's wrong?"
<0212> \{[Hope]}
<0213> "Seeing Rei without her glasses,
<0214> \ This is my first time...!
<0215> \{[Rei]}
<0216> "Do you find such small things enjoyable?"
<0217> \{[Hope]}
<0218> "Yes, very much...!"
<0219> \{[Rei]}
<0220> "I see - that's good."
<0221> Nozomi's fingers touched me again,
<0222> The comfort of gently stroking your hair,
<0223> Rei leaned back, dozing off.
<0224> Don't let anyone know about your escape plan.
<0225> Silently waiting for the moment that will decide our fate,
<0226> The tense day passes quietly.
<0227> At this point, I have done everything I can to help Rei.
<0228> All that's left now is to wait for the fateful moment.
<0229> In an attempt to release Nozomi's tense body and mind,
<0230> Rei spends as much time as possible by Nozomi's side.
<0231> And thenーnight falls on the mansion.
<0232> Nozomi, who was having dinner with me, looked uneasy.
<0233> I couldn't bring myself to leave him alone after that.
<0234> I invited Nozomi into my room and made time to read a book to her.
<0235> As the two spend a peaceful time together,
<0236> Late at night, a frantic knock brings news.
<0237> \{[Mari]}
<0238> "Rei-sama, Takami-sama has arrived...!"
<0239> \{[Rei]}
<0240> "I see. ...You've finally come."
<0241> Negotiations with the client were difficult, or work was hectic,
<0242> Takami visited the mansion with Nozomi,
<0243> There were only a few hours left until the date changed.
<0244> He suddenly closed the book he was reading to Nozomi,
<0245> Rei quietly stands up.
<0246> \{[Nozomi]}
<0247> "Rei-san..."
<0248> He looks up at Rei with a slightly frightened expression.
<0249> As if to reassure Nozomi, he grasps her fingers, which are stiff with tension.
<0250> \{[Rei]}
<0251> "It's okay, Nozomi... I'm here with you.
<0252> \ Be brave.
<0253> \{[Hope]}
<0254> "Yes..."
<0255> \{[Rei]}
<0256> "Mari. As we agreed last night,
<0257> \ I'll leave the rest to you."
<0258> \{[Mari]} "Yes, leave it to me...!"
<0259> In order for Marie to carry out her final operation,
<0260> Rei kept Takami in the room for as long as possible,
<0261> We must buy ourselves some time.
<0262> Rei would make excuses and delay leaving her room,
<0263> Takami was left waiting alone for a long time.
<0264> \{[Maid]}
<0265> "Saiga-sama and Takami-sama have come to the mansion.
<0266> \ I'll be waiting for you in the reception room.
<0267> \{[Rei]}
<0268> "I see. ...Looks like you've finally arrived."
<0269> Negotiations with the client were difficult, or work was hectic,
<0270> Takami visited the mansion with Nozomi,
<0271> There were only a few hours left until the date changed.
<0272> He suddenly closed the book he was reading to Nozomi,
<0273> Rei quietly stands up.
<0274> \{[Nozomi]}
<0275> "Rei-san..."
<0276> He looks up at Rei with a slightly frightened expression.
<0277> As if to reassure Nozomi, he grasps her fingers, which are stiff with tension.
<0278> \{[Rei]}
<0279> "It's okay, Nozomi... I'm here with you.
<0280> \ Be brave.
<0281> \{[Hope]}
<0282> "Yes..."
<0283> To put the finishing touches on escaping the mansion,
<0284> Takami was kept in his room.
<0285> We must buy ourselves some time.
<0286> Rei would make excuses to delay going to the reception room,
<0287> Act secretly,
<0288> Meanwhile, Takami was left waiting alone for a long time.
<0289> It became clear that this could not be delayed any further.
<0290> Finally, Rei heads to the reception room.
<0291> When Rei stepped into the reception room,
<0292> Takami, who had been kept waiting, took out all of his frustration on Rei.
<0293> \{[Takami]}
<0294> "Rei! How long are you going to keep people waiting?!"
<0295> \{[Rei]}
<0296> "Oh, sorry.
<0297> \ I was a little busy so I'm late.
<0298> \{[Rei]}
<0299> "Even so, you were pretty late too.
<0300> \ I didn't think you'd keep me waiting until this late at night.
<0301> \{[Takami]}
<0302> "...I think I was wrong about that too.
<0303> \ I've been busy with work too."
<0304> \{[Rei]}
<0305> "It's so late, I thought you weren't coming tonight.
<0306> \ Couldn't you find someone to buy Nozomi?
<0307> \{[Takami]}
<0308> "Well, it was a sudden request, but it was decided smoothly."
<0309> \{[Rei]}
<0310> "...I see."
<0311> \{[Takami]}
<0312> "It's getting quite late, but the person who came to pick it up tonight is
<0313> \ It was at their request."
<0314> \{[Takami]}
<0315> "I'm sorry to bother you at this time,
<0316> \ I'll take Nozomi right away--"
<0317> \{[Rei]}
<0318> "Well, there's no need to rush, right?
<0319> \ I wish they'd give us time to say goodbye."
<0320> \{[Takami]}
<0321> "Take care of that during the day!"
<0322> \{[Rei]}
<0323> "You don't understand, do you? No matter how much we talk during the day,
<0324> \ This moment of parting is special."
<0325> \{[Rei]}
<0326> "Let me enjoy the time I have to bid farewell."
<0327> \{[Takami]}
<0328> "...I had no idea you two were so close.
<0329> \ I didn't know that.
<0330> \{[Rei]}
<0331> "We're friends because we lived in the same mansion.
<0332> \ There was a fair amount of interaction between us.
<0333> \{[Takami]}
<0334> "...But then,
<0335> \ You agreed to hand over Nozomi surprisingly easily.
<0336> \{[Rei]}
<0337> "Oh, I was just obediently following your wishes,
<0338> \ So that was such a bad thing..."
<0339> \{[Takami]}
<0340> "No, it's not that that's a bad thing,
<0341> \ I was just wondering..."
<0342> \{[Rei]}
<0343> "So you have no complaints?"
<0344> \{[Takami]}
<0345> "...Well, I guess so."
<0346> \{[Rei]}
<0347> "By the way, if you plan to take me out of the mansion,
<0348> \ Isn't it about time we took Nozomi off her collar?
<0349> \{[Takami]}
<0350> "Ahhーa collar. That's right."
<0351> In response to Rei's comment,
<0352> Takami nods, as if suddenly remembering something.
<0353> Trying to get the key out,
<0354> At that moment, Takami raised his right hand up to his chest.
<0355> Suddenly, all the lights in the building went out.
<0356> \{[Takami]}
<0357> "What... what? A power outage?"
<0358> Without warning, I was suddenly thrown into the pitch black world of night,
<0359> Only Takami's voice echoed in the darkness.
<0360> \{[Rei]}
<0361> "What do you mean, Takami? What happened?"
<0362> \{[Takami]}
<0363> "I don't know. The breaker in the building tripped.
<0364> \ It looks like there's been a power outage..."
<0365> \{[Takami]}
<0366> "Well, nothing to worry about.
<0367> \ Someone from the mansion will restore it soon."
<0368> \{[Takami]}
<0369> "And just in case,
<0370> \ The building also has a backup generator.
<0371> \ It should return to normal after a while.
<0372> \{[Rei]}
<0373> "I see..."
<0374> Takami agreed without any sign of concern,
<0375> Rei waited quietly for the lights to come back on.
<0376> However――
<0377> I held my breath in the darkness, waiting for the lights to come back on,
<0378> The situation shows no signs of improving.
<0379> \{[Takami]}
<0380> "...That's strange. If it's just a power outage,
<0381> \ It's about time the lights came on."
<0382> \{[Takami]}
<0383> "Why doesn't it switch over to backup power?
<0384> \ All the spares will be unavailable at the same time.
<0385> \ That shouldn't be possible..."
<0386> \{[Rei]}
<0387> "Something unexpected has happened?"
<0388> \{[Takami]}
<0389> "I don't know...!"
<0390> With weak fingers, he pulled Rei's sleeve as if clinging to it,
<0391> The voice was filled with deep fear.
<0392> He whispers in a very desperate and unusual tone.
<0393> \{[Hope]}
<0394> "Rei-san, something's strange...!
<0395> \ There's something very... strange about this...!"
<0396> \{[Rei]}
<0397> "Something strange? What on earth is that?"
<0398> \{[Hope]}
<0399> "I don't know. I've never heard that before..."
<0400> \{[Nozomi]}
<0401> "Somehow... it feels close,
<0402> \ No, or it seems like it's much, much farther away--"
<0403> \{[Hope]}
<0404> "It's a strange... sound."
<0405> \{[Rei]}
<0406> "...?"
<0407> The vague expression of hope,
<0408> Rei is confused and tilts her head.
<0409> \{[Hope]}
<0410> "...Scary..."
<0411> \{[Rei]}
<0412> “Nozomi…”
<0413> \{[Takami]}
<0414> "What on earth is going on?
<0415> Hey, can someone please come and explain this quickly?
<0416> Takami shouted out to the outside of the room,
<0417> The voice echoed hollowly in the hall, as quiet as a pond.
<0418> \{[Rei]}
<0419> "...Even after all this time,
<0420> \ It's strange that no one has come to inform me of the situation."
<0421> \{[Rei]}
<0422> "And... don't you notice, Takami?
<0423> \ The mansion is too quiet."
<0424> \{[Takami]}
<0425> "Now that you mention it... it's certainly too quiet..."
<0426> All the lights are out and still not restored,
<0427> The building was unnaturally quiet.
<0428> And then, frightened by the presence of something unknown,
<0429> Nozomi muttered these words while trembling.
<0430> --I have a bad feeling about this.
<0431> It feels as though something is quietly progressing in this darkness.
<0432> I feel extremely unsafe.
<0433> \{[Rei]}
<0434> (This mansion is no good. I need to get out of here quickly...)
<0435> Rei follows the danger signals her instincts are telling her,
<0436> I decide to leave the mansion immediately.
<0437> However, we don't know what happened to the mansion, and in this situation,
<0438> Being alone with Nozomi,
<0439> This is a very unsettling and potentially dangerous act.
<0440> At least until the situation becomes a little clearer,
<0441> We need people who can be a valuable asset in an emergency.
<0442> And if you look for someone who can help you,
<0443> He's the only one here.
<0444> \{[Rei]}
<0445> (Takami――?)
<0446> Something strange is happening inside the building.
<0447> Takami seems genuinely shaken.
<0448> If this surprise isn't an act,
<0449> Is it possible to cooperate with Takami?
<0450> \{[Takami]}
<0451> "...Don't you think that's unpleasant, Rei?"
<0452> \{[Takami]}
<0453> "Until we know the situation,
<0454> \ Perhaps it would be best if we didn't leave either."
<0455> \{[Rei]}
<0456> "...That's true..."
<0457> \{[Takami]}
<0458> "I'm going to go and check out what's going on inside the building,
<0459> \ What will you do?
<0460> In response to Takami's proposal,
<0461> Rei thinks for a moment, unsure of what to do.
<0462> \{[Rei]}
<0463> (...What should we do?
<0464> \ Should I continue to work with Takami?
<0465> \{[Rei]}
<0466> (If this incident is something Takami is unaware of,
<0467> Should I trust Takami and join forces?
<0468> Trust Takami
<0469> Steal the key
<0470> \{[Rei]}
<0471> (--It doesn't matter what's happening at the mansion.
<0472> \ I can't trust Takami.)
<0473> \{[Rei]}
<0474> (In fact, this is a good opportunity. I'll take the key from Takami.)
<0475> Rei has decided to defeat Takami and take the key.
<0476> Following the voice and the presence of others, I silently crept up to Takami,
<0477> Groping for the vase in both hands, he raised it.
<0478> \{[Takami]}
<0479> "Uh...!?"
<0480> Overlapping with the sound of breaking pottery,
<0481> Takami lets out a hoarse scream as the vase is slammed into him.
<0482> \{[Takami]}
<0483> "Rei... is that you...?"
<0484> \{[Rei]}
<0485> "I'm sorry, but I don't ask for your forgiveness--"
<0486> \{[Takami]}
<0487> "Ugh..."
<0488> There was a dull sound as Takami fell to the floor, leaving behind a painful groan.
<0489> A hollow echo echoed around.
<0490> \{[Nozomi]}
<0491> "Rei-san..."
<0492> \{[Rei]}
<0493> "Nozomi, I'll look for the key that Takami has.
<0494> \ Please bring out the handcuffs and rope you prepared. Hurry!
<0495> \{[Hope]}
<0496> "Y-yes."
<0497> I managed to get my eyes used to the darkness, and by the faint light,
<0498> I grope around Takami's clothes for the key I'm looking for.
<0499> \{[Rei]}
<0500> "--Found it!"
<0501> Finally finding the small key I was looking for, I breathed a sigh of relief.
<0502> \{[Rei]}
<0503> "Nozomi, come here. I'll take off your collar."
<0504> \{[Nozomi]}
<0505> "Yes...!"
<0506> I somehow managed to find the keyhole in the collar,
<0507> I finally got the key and immediately tried it out.
<0508> A faint electronic click sounded,
<0509> Nozomi's collar comes off.
<0510> \{[Rei]}
<0511> "Okay, I missed...!"
<0512> However, there was no time to revel in the joy of having been freed from the shackles.
<0513> The unconscious Takami's hands and feet were handcuffed and tied with rope.
<0514> He is gagged to prevent him from making any noise.
<0515> By the time all the tedious work was finally done,
<0516> A fair amount of time had passed.
<0517> \{[Rei]}
<0518> "This took longer than expected.
<0519> \ ...Let's hurry, Nozomi.
<0520> \{[Nozomi]}
<0521> "Yes...!"
<0522> I need to get out of the mansion before they notice me,
<0523> I found the small key in the dark and used it to restrain Takami.
<0524> This took up more time than I expected.
<0525> Rei shields Nozomi's body from behind,
<0526> I came out into a hallway plunged in pitch darkness, without even a streetlight.
<0527> Rei looked around the silent corridor on both sides,
<0528> Still no one in sight.
<0529> \{[Rei]}
<0530> (That's strange...)
<0531> \{[Rei]}
<0532> (It must have been quite some time since the lights went out,
<0533> \ There seems to be some commotion going on in the mansion.
<0534> No one has come to inform Takami of the situation.
<0535> \{[Rei]}
<0536> (What on earth is this...?)
<0537> And then――at that moment.
<0538> \{[Rei]}
<0539> "…………!?"
<0540> Suddenly, Rei sensed the presence of something other than themselves.
<0541> I sensed it in the darkness behind me.
<0542> \{[Rei]}
<0543> (Someone other than us is here!)
<0544> A chill down my spine,
<0545> I started to turn around in the direction I felt the presenceー
<0546> A quick, silent arm stretched out from behind me.
<0547> Rei's movements were controlled.
<0548> \{[Rei]}
<0549> "――!!"
<0550> A cloth soaked in some kind of chemical was tightly pressed against my mouth.
<0551> Unable to resist, she is forced to drink the drug.
<0552> The strong smell of chemicals made me dizzy,
<0553> My whole body was relaxed,
<0554> My consciousness sinks helplessly into darkness.
<0555> Unable to endure, my body collapsed to the floor from my feet,
<0556> Someone catches it in their arms.
<0557> \{[Rei]}
<0558> “…Who…?”
<0559> However, as my vision rapidly sank into darkness,
<0560> I can't see his face.
<0561> \{[Nozomi]}
<0562> "Rei-san...!"
<0563> \{[Rei]}
<0564> "Nozomi... Run... from here..."
<0565> He tries to respond to Nozomi's screams calling out Rei's name, but
<0566> I can no longer even speak.
<0567> Rei heard a familiar sound in her ears.
<0568> He says with a wry smile.
<0569> \{[? ]}
<0570> "Rei - I've come to take you."
<0571> \{[Rei]}
<0572> "...Who...are you...?"
<0573> \{[? ]}
<0574> "It would be better for you not to know,
<0575> \ Well, that's right - I'll just wait for you to wake up,
<0576> \ I guess I'll introduce myself.
<0577> \{[Rei]}
<0578> "My...awakening...?
<0579> \ What on earth is going on...?
<0580> \{[? ]}
<0581> "It's okay if you don't understand it yet.
<0582> \ We'll find out eventually--"
<0583> \{[Rei]}
<0584> "...What does that mean...?"
<0585> \{[Rei]}
<0586> "That's right... Nozomi... yes."
<0587> \{[? ]}
<0588> "You mean the imitation Angel?
<0589> \ That's right, she has other uses too,
<0590> \ I'll use it to the best of my ability."
<0591> \{[Rei]}
<0592> "Don't lay a hand on Nozomi!"
<0593> \{[? ]}
<0594> "Well, you see -- what should we do?"
<0595> \{[Rei]}
<0596> "...!"
<0597> \{[? ]}
<0598> "Come on, Rei. Just go to bed well for tonight.
<0599> \ The next time you wake up, you'll be--"
<0600> As my consciousness fades, I sense a ripple of laughter.
<0601> It echoes in Rei's ears forever.
<0602> \{[Rei]}
<0603> (Who on earth... could have... me?)
<0604> Repeating questions that will never be answered,
<0605> Rei's consciousness sank into the depths of darkness.
<0606> \{[Rei]}
<0607> (I believe in Takami's attitude.)
<0608> \{[Rei]}
<0609> (Since we don't know the situation,
<0610> We should join forces with Takami, who knows the mansion.
<0611> Rei has decided to join forces with Takami.
<0612> He answered Takami clearly.
<0613> \{[Rei]}
<0614> "...I understand. I'll join forces with you here."
<0615> By declaring that he would cooperate with Takami,
<0616> I was worried that this would make Nozomi uneasy,
<0617> It seems that Nozomi understood Rei's thoughts.
<0618> As if to convey his trust in Rei,
<0619> Nozomi gripped Rei's fingers tightly.
<0620> And so, they suddenly formed a cooperative relationship.
<0621> The three of them decided to travel together.
<0622> \{[Rei]}
<0623> "Let's get out of this room first."
<0624> It was a dark night, with the new moon fast approaching.
<0625> When the lights in the building, even the night lights illuminating the hallways, were turned off,
<0626> The area is enveloped in deep darkness, blending into the surrounding forest.
<0627> I strained my eyes, relying on the faint moonlight,
<0628> My eyes finally got used to the dim light that seemed to envelop me,
<0629> Although unsteady, he is able to walk without fumbling around.
<0630> \{[Takami]}
<0631> "Hey... is anyone there?
<0632> \ Come out quickly!
<0633> As if trying to dispel the feeling of anxiety,
<0634> Takami raises his voice loudly.
<0635> However, despite the master's orders,
<0636> No one shows up.
<0637> \{[Rei]}
<0638> "...Takami, something's strange inside the building.
<0639> \ It's best not to shout and let people know where we are."
<0640> \{[Takami]}
<0641> "Oh, yeah... that's right."
<0642> I began to investigate the darkness in a hushed voice.
<0643> It was soon discovered that the mansion was in a strange state.
<0644> People have disappeared from every room in the mansion.
<0645> It was as if, apart from Rei and the others,
<0646> It's as if no one had ever been there in the first place.
<0647> \{[Takami]}
<0648> "What on earth is happening in this mansion?!"
<0649> \{[Rei]}
<0650> "I don't know - where did everyone go?"
<0651> \{[Takami]}
<0652> "Rei, what are you going to do now?"
<0653> \{[Rei]}
<0654> "What strange thing is happening in the mansion?
<0655> \ Is there anyone left in the mansion who knows the cause of the incident?
<0656> \ I need to check that--"
<0657> \{[Rei]}
<0658> "Now, which direction should I head...?"
<0659> If you head to the right of the hallway, you will find the dining room and kitchen.
<0660> There are facilities such as a security system control room.
<0661> Go left down the hallway, down the stairs,
<0662> You will now head to the entrance hall.
<0663> Listen to Nozomi's opinion
<0664> Listen to Takami's opinion
<0665> Follow your intuition
<0666> \{[Rei]}
<0667> "Nozomi, which way do you think we should go?
<0668> \ Is there anything you can feel?
<0669> \{[Nozomi]}
<0670> "Something you can feel...?"
<0671> Nozomi concentrated intently on Rei's question,
<0672> I listened to the sounds around me,
<0673> He suddenly trembled in fear and said.
<0674> \{[Hope]}
<0675> "...I'm feeling very scared from this side,
<0676> \ I sense something unpleasant..."
<0677> \{[Rei]}
<0678> "Leftーthat is, towards the entrance hall."
<0679> \{[Rei]}
<0680> "Takami, as someone who knows the mansion well,
<0681> \ Any suggestions on which way we should go?"
<0682> \{[Takami]}
<0683> "Well... what happened to the security inside the building?
<0684> \ I want to understand that,
<0685> \ I want to take a look at the security system control room.
<0686> \{[Rei]}
<0687> "So you want to go to the right?"
<0688> \{[Rei]}
<0689> (I guess I'll just follow my intuition when deciding what to do...)
<0690> \{[Takami]}
<0691> "Rei, so you,
<0692> \ So where are you planning to go?"
<0693> \{[Rei]}
<0694> "That's true..."
<0695> Go left
<0696> Go right
<0697> \{[Rei]}
<0698> "Let's go left."
<0699> I walked down the hallway to the left,
<0700> The entire mansion was unnaturally quiet.
<0701> There is no sign of anyone here.
<0702> I peeked into the room several times while passing by,
<0703> No one is visible in any of the rooms.
<0704> I opened the door to the last room along the long corridor.
<0705> Let's take a look inside.
<0706> But there was no one there either.
<0707> The rest can be seen at the end of the corridor.
<0708> All that's left is to go through the door that leads to the entrance hall.
<0709> \{[Takami]}
<0710> "...Shall we head down the hall?"
<0711> \{[Rei]}
<0712> "That's true..."
<0713> When the group reached the spacious entrance hall,
<0714> The thin, fragile moon is hidden by the clouds,
<0715> The moonlight that we had been relying on for a little while disappears.
<0716> Surrounded by a dense darkness that makes it hard to breathe,
<0717> I hesitate to even whisper.
<0718> And then――at that moment.
<0719> \{[Rei]}
<0720> "…………!?"
<0721> Suddenly, Rei sensed the presence of something other than themselves.
<0722> I sensed it in the darkness.
<0723> \{[Rei]}
<0724> (Someone other than us is here!)
<0725> He tried to warn Takami, who was walking beside him.
<0726> At that moment.
<0727> \{[Takami]}
<0728> "Ugh..."
<0729> Takami's small moan echoed in the darkness.
<0730> This was followed by the sound of something heavy falling to the floor.
<0731> \{[Rei]}
<0732> "...Takami?!"
<0733> \{[? ? ]}
<0734> "--Quickly, capture him!"
<0735> \{[Rei]}
<0736> "!? Who is that--!"
<0737> A voice gave a sharp command in Takami's place,
<0738> Sensing danger, Rei quickly moves in...
<0739> But before that, an arm silently reached out from the darkness,
<0740> He was one step ahead of Rei's movements.
<0741> \{[Rei]}
<0742> "――!!"
<0743> A cloth soaked in some kind of chemical was tightly pressed against my mouth.
<0744> Unable to resist, she is forced to drink the drug.
<0745> The strong smell of chemicals made me dizzy,
<0746> My whole body was relaxed.
<0747> My consciousness sinks unstoppably into darkness.
<0748> Unable to endure, my body collapsed to the floor from my feet,
<0749> Someone catches it in their arms.
<0750> \{[Rei]}
<0751> “…Who…?”
<0752> However, as my vision rapidly sank into darkness,
<0753> I can't see his face.
<0754> \{[Hope]}
<0755> "Rei-san...!"
<0756> \{[Rei]}
<0757> "Nozomi... Run... from here..."
<0758> He tries to respond to Nozomi's screams calling out Rei's name, but
<0759> I can no longer even speak.
<0760> Rei heard a familiar sound in her ears.
<0761> He says with a wry smile.
<0762> \{[? ]}
<0763> "Rei - I've come to take you."
<0764> \{[Rei]}
<0765> "...Who...are you...?"
<0766> \{[? ]}
<0767> "It would be better for you not to know,
<0768> \ Well, that's right - I'll just wait for you to wake up,
<0769> \ I guess I should introduce myself.

<0771> "My...awakening...?

<0773> \{[? ]}
<0774> "It's okay if you don't understand it yet.
<0775> \ We'll find out eventually--"
<0776> \{[Rei]}
<0777> "...What does that mean...?"
<0778> \{[Rei]}
<0779> "That's right... Nozomi... yes."
<0780> \{[? ]}
<0781> "You mean the imitation Angel?
<0782> \ That's right, she has other uses too,
<0783> \ I'll use it as much as I can."
<0784> \{[Rei]}
<0785> "Don't lay a hand on Nozomi!"
<0786> \{[? ]}
<0787> "Well, you see -- what should we do?"
<0788> \{[Rei]}
<0789> "...!"
<0790> \{[? ]}
<0791> "Come on, Rei. Just go to bed well for tonight.

<0793> As my consciousness fades, I sense a ripple of laughter.
<0794> It echoes in Rei's ears forever.
<0795> \{[Rei]}
<0796> (Who on earth... could have... me?)
<0797> Repeating questions that will never be answered,
<0798> Rei's consciousness sank into the depths of darkness.
<0799> \{[Rei]}
<0800> "Go right"
<0801> I walked down the hallway to the right,
<0802> The entire mansion was unnaturally quiet.
<0803> There is no sign of anyone here.
<0804> \{[Rei]}
<0805> "No one here...?"
<0806> \{[Takami]}
<0807> "That can't be! There are no guards in the mansion,
<0808> \ There should be more than ten people stationed there."
<0809> \{[Takami]}
<0810> "It would be rude for everyone to leave their posts together.
<0811> \ That's impossible...!
<0812> But if a dozen people are working,
<0813> The voices and sounds that should surely be heard,
<0814> No matter how carefully I listen, I can't hear it.
<0815> \{[Rei]}
<0816> "...It's so quiet that it feels like there's no one here."
<0817> \{[Takami]}
<0818> "That can't be..."
<0819> \{[Rei]}
<0820> "This won't get us anywhere.
<0821> \ Anyway, let's check the room."
<0822> \{[Takami]}
<0823> "So, where should we start?"
<0824> Check the kitchen
<0825> Search the waiting room
<0826> That's enough
<0827> The kitchen was just preparing for the next day's meal.
<0828> It seems they were in the middle of preparing the ingredients.
<0829> On the chopping board was a fish that was in the process of being gutted.
<0830> The tap in the bathroom was left fully open and overflowing with water.
<0831> The soup is bubbling away in the pot.
<0832> However, there was no one there.
<0833> \{[Rei]}
<0834> "It doesn't seem like you're just out and about..."
<0835> \{[Rei]}
<0836> "It's unthinkable for a chef to leave the kitchen with a pot on the stove.
<0837> \ It's an unthinkable situation under normal circumstances."
<0838> \{[Rei]}
<0839> "I can't help but think that something has happened."
<0840> \{[Takami]}
<0841> "...What on earth happened?"
<0842> \{[Rei]}
<0843> "I don't know. I just know that something strange is happening in the mansion.
<0844> \ It seems certain, but..."
<0845> \{[Rei]}
<0846> "Now, what should I do next...?"
<0847> Normally, maids and servants would be waiting,
<0848> The waiting room was also deserted.
<0849> On the table,
<0850> Perhaps it's for those who have finished their work to enjoy a moment of relaxation,
<0851> Snacks and cold drinks are available.
<0852> The sweets are still half-eaten,
<0853> The drink was half gone, and the ice in the glass hadn't even melted.
<0854> It's left there.
<0855> Rei touches the glass that was left there,
<0856> The thoughts of the person who had been using it until just a moment ago
<0857> I try to touch it.
<0858> Focus your mind,
<0859> I try to read the fragments of your thoughts, but--
<0860> \{[Rei]}
<0861> (--It's no good, I can't read anything.
<0862> \ Fear and confusion,
<0863> \ No strong thoughts remain here.)
<0864> \{[Rei]}
<0865> (In a very short space of time,
<0866> \ They appear to have disappeared--)
<0867> \{[Takami]}
<0868> "Where did they go...?"
<0869> Any clues to the disappearances?
<0870> It's not left anywhere in the room.
<0871> The three of us searched the room for a while,
<0872> Finding nothing, we finally gave up searching.
<0873> \{[Rei]}
<0874> "Now, what should I do next...?"
<0875> After looking around, I realized that
<0876> From every room, there was a presence of people.
<0877> It completely vanished, leaving only traces behind.
<0878> \{[Rei]}
<0879> "This is just like what happened on board the Marie Celeste,
<0880> \ It seems like a disappearance case..."
<0881> \{[Nozomi]}
<0882> "The disappearance of the Marie Celeste...?"
<0883> \{[Rei]}
<0884> "This is a famous disappearance case from history. December 5, 1872,
<0885> \ Off the coast of Portugal, near the Azores Islands,
<0886> \ A sailing ship has been found after the entire crew mysteriously disappeared.
<0887> \{[Rei]}
<0888> "The hull was mostly intact, and food, water, and cargo were all still there.
<0889> \ In the kitchen, a pot was on the fire,
<0890> \ Apparently there was some half-eaten food left in the dining room.
<0891> \{[Rei]}
<0892> "Leaving the impression that someone had been there just a few minutes ago,
<0893> Only the people on board the Marie Celeste have disappeared.
<0894> \{[Hope]}
<0895> "Ah..."
<0896> He was told about a past disappearance case that was very similar to the situation he was in.
<0897> Nozomi's face turns pale, as if she is frightened.
<0898> \{[Takami]}
<0899> "...That's a creepy story. The situations are similar and it makes me sick.
<0900> \ So, what was the cause of the disappearance?
<0901> \{[Rei]}
<0902> "We don't know what happened to them.
<0903> The whereabouts of the 10 crew members, including a two-year-old child, remain unknown.
<0904> \ The truth has yet to be revealed.

<0906> "One of the strange phenomena that actually occurred on ships is
<0907> \ This is a story that is still told today..."
<0908> \{[Hope]}
<0909> “…mysterious phenomenon…”
<0910> \{[Takami]}
<0911> "Hey! What kind of story are you telling me at a time like this?
<0912> \ Now that's even more creepy, seriously..."
<0913> \{[Rei]}
<0914> "Oh, that's right. Sorry.
<0915> \ I didn't mean to scare you, but..."
<0916> \{[Rei]}
<0917> "Anyway, sitting here won't get us anywhere.
<0918> \ ...Let's move on."
<0919> \{[Takami]}
<0920> "Yeah, I agree."
<0921> \{[Takami]}
<0922> "Let's head to the security system control room at the back.
<0923> \ There must be someone there."
<0924> Running through the deserted corridor,
<0925> Soon, Rei and the others arrive at the door they are aiming for.
<0926> Inlaid into the surface of a heavy wooden door,
<0927> The letters written on the metal plate,
<0928> Rei tried reading it out loud slowly.
<0929> \{[Rei]}
<0930> "Security Systems Control Room..."
<0931> \{[Takami]}
<0932> "There is always a system administrator in the control room.
<0933> \ This place will be deserted,
<0934> \ It should have been absolutely impossible... but..."
<0935> \{[Rei]}
<0936> "...Let's open it."
<0937> \{[Rei]}
<0938> "...No one here."
<0939> \{[Takami]}
<0940> "Damn it! That can't be true...!"
<0941> \{[Rei]}
<0942> "Apparently, the security system sensors,
<0943> \ It looks like everything's turned off here."
<0944> \{[Rei]}
<0945> "...It's no good, the circuit has been cut somewhere.
<0946> \ The system does not recover even when the emergency power switch is pressed.

<0948> "Who on earth would do something like this...?!"
<0949> \{[Rei]}
<0950> "The only way to prevent recovery so accurately is to

<0961> "Unfortunately, I can't help but think that way.
<0962> \ In this situation..."
<0963> \{[Rei]}
<0964> "If you think about it, something must have happened in this mansion.
<0965> \ At that moment and afterwards,
<0966> \ It makes sense why there was no fuss.
<0967> \{[Takami]}
<0968> "Damn it...!"
<0969> \{[Rei]}
<0970> "That means... it's dangerous to stay in the mansion like this.
<0971> \ We should leave the mansion as soon as possible."
<0972> \{[Takami]}
<0973> "Okay. Let's head to the entrance hall."
<0974> \{[Rei]}
<0975> "...That's right."
<0976> When the group reached the spacious entrance hall,
<0977> The fragile moon is hidden by the clouds,
<0978> The moonlight that we had been relying on for a little while disappears.
<0979> Surrounded by a dense darkness that makes it hard to breathe,
<0980> I hesitate to even whisper.
<0981> \{[Rei]}
<0982> (What――?)
<0983> In the depths of darkness, where you can't see even an inch ahead,
<0984> I sense something moving.
<0985> It has an ominous smell that makes your skin bubbling.
<0986> The presence doesn't seem to be human.
<0987> Rei wasn't the only one who noticed the ominous presence.
<0988> I walked behind Rei, snuggling close to her.
<0989> Nozomi's fingers tug tightly at Rei's sleeve, as if frightened.
<0990> Takami, who was walking next to me,
<0991> You can sense the tension and breathlessness.
<0992> \{[Takami]}
<0993> "--Who is it? Is someone there?
<0994> \ If you are there, answer me!
<0995> The moon, like a cat's eyes, peeks out again from between the clouds,
<0996> Twilight slowly returns to the hall.
<0997> As if answering Takami's question,
<0998> A dark shadow, like a congealed darkness of the night, moves slowly.
<0999> Like a beast stalking its prey, it makes no sound.
<1000> From the depths of the painted-on darkness,
<1001> Under the faint moonlight, something slowly appears...
<1002> So, is that really――
<1003> A person?
<1004> \{[Rei]}
<1005> "...!"
<1006> The shock of what I saw was overwhelming.
<1007> Next to Rei, who was frozen in place,
<1008> Nozomi, who also gasped in surprise, muttered in a faint, trembling voice.
<1009> \{[hope]}
<1010> "...Ah...that person's face."
<1011> \{[Nozomi]}
<1012> "Rei-san... she looks just like him...!"
<1013> Who is that?
<1014> Although she has the same face as Rei,
<1015> Not like Rei - the one with a faint smile.
<1016> Who is that?
<1017> \{[Takami]}
<1018> "Who are you...?! Who are you..."
<1019> \{[? ]}
<1020> "You are Kujo Takami, right?
<1021> \ The young head of the Kujo family who inherited the family after the death of the previous head, Kujo Takahisa..."
<1022> \{[Takami]}
<1023> "...!"
<1024> \{[? ]}
<1025> "And you, who are next to him,
<1026> \ Saiga Rei――”
<1027> \{[? ]}
<1028> "Nice to meet you, Rei. I've always wanted to meet you."
<1029> \{[Rei]}
<1030> "...I don't know you."
<1031> \{[? ]}
<1032> "I know you better than that."
<1033> \{[? ]}
<1034> "You are my precious half."
<1035> \{[Rei]}
<1036> "Who are you?"
<1037> \{[? ]}
<1038> "--I don't have a name."
<1039> \{[? ]}
<1040> "There is only
<1041> \ They are just names given to me by those who fear me.
<1042> \{[Nue]}
<1043> "Yes... they call me '\ruby{Nue}={Nue}'"
<1044> \{[Rei]}
<1045> "\ruby{Nue}={Nue}..."
<1046> This is what remains in ancient legends such as the Tale of the Heike.
<1047> The name of a strange, sinister monster.
<1048> The name is too sinister to be given to a person,
<1049> For some reason, it seemed very fitting for him.
<1050> \{[Takami]}
<1051> "Who are you? This is my mansion.
<1052> \ You are not permitted to enter without the master's permission...!"
<1053> \{[Nue]}
<1054> "You won't forgive me...
<1055> \ So, what does the head of Kujo intend to do with me?
<1056> \{[Nue]}
<1057> "Hand me over to the police as a trespasser?
<1058> Or should I beat him up and kick him out of the mansion?
<1059> \{[Nue]}
<1060> "Fufu... In any case, first of all,
<1061> \ You'll have to start by capturing me..."
<1062> \{[Nue]}
<1063> "Who will capture me? You?
<1064> Or will you leave it to the mansion's security personnel?"
<1065> \{[Nue]}
<1066> "But unfortunately, the only people living in this mansion are
<1067> \ There's no one else but you and me."
<1068> \{[Nue]}
<1069> "No, that's not quite right. Let me correct that."
<1070> \{[Nue]}
<1071> "Young head of Kujo, in this mansion,
<1072> \ There is no other living person in existence except you.
<1073> \{[Takami]}
<1074> "What--?"
<1075> \{[Nue]}
<1076> "Among those present in this mansion,
<1077> \ There is not a single human man other than you.
<1078> \ That's what I said..."
<1079> \{[Takami]}
<1080> "Could it be that... you're the reason the mansion is deserted?
<1081> \ You did it!
<1082> \{[Nue]}
<1083> "Yes, what would you do if I said so?"
<1084> \{[Takami]}
<1085> "You...!"
<1086> \{[Rei]}
<1087> "...Among those present in this mansion,
<1088> \ You said that there was no other human being than Takami."
<1089> \{[Rei]}
<1090> "Humans are--"
<1091> \{[Rei]}
<1092> "The number of people surviving in the mansion,
<1093> \ If that includes you..."
<1094> \{[Rei]}
<1095> "So you're not a 'human' either?"
<1096> \{[Takami]}
<1097> "What...! What does that mean?
<1098> \ This guy isn't human..."
<1099> \{[Nue]}
<1100> "--As expected, you have good intuition.
<1101> \ I like intelligent people."
<1102> \{[Nue]}
<1103> "Ahhーor perhaps you, at the moment of our meeting,
<1104> \ Perhaps you had already sensed it?
<1105> \{[Nue]}
<1106> "Who am I..."
<1107> \{[Rei]}
<1108> "You're just like me. --That's how I feel."
<1109> \{[Rei]}
<1110> "You are... an angel."
<1111> \{[Takami]}
<1112> "What...?"
<1113> \{[Nue]}
<1114> "Yes - I am an Angel.
<1115> \ Just like you... right?"
<1116> \{[hope]}
<1117> "Is she also... an Angel?"
<1118> \{[Nozomi]}
<1119> "But...!
<1120> \ That person is so scary...!
<1121> \{[hope]}
<1122> "Just like Rei-san... I can't believe you're an Angel!"
<1123> \{[Nue]}
<1124> "Hmm... Even if you're half-baked, you're still a member of the Angels.
<1125> \ You understand, don't you?
<1126> \{[Nue]}
<1127> "I'm not just an angel,
<1128> \ Have you noticed it--"
<1129> \{[Nozomi]}
<1130> "--!"
<1131> The young man's gaze gazed upon me,
<1132> Nozomi shivered in horror.
<1133> \{[Rei]}
<1134> "Nozomi... what's wrong?"
<1135> \{[Nozomi]}
<1136> "...that person...is really scary..."
<1137> \{[Nue]}
<1138> "Rei, do you have any idea who I am?
<1139> \ What kind of being am I..."
<1140> \{[Rei]}
<1141> "......"
<1142> \{[Rei]}
<1143> "The replica that Kujo Takahisa created from the blood of the Angel,
<1144> \ I was alone..."
<1145> \{[Rei]}
<1146> "Takahisa only created me,
<1147> \ No further attempts were made to create copies of the Angel.
<1148> \{[Takami]}
<1149> "...Rei! Did you know?"
<1150> \{[Rei]}
<1151> "Yeah, I did a little research."
<1152> \{[Rei]}
<1153> "But--"
<1154> \{[Rei]}
<1155> "Someone other than Takahisa is researching how to create Angel clones.
<1156> \ What if it continued after that...?
<1157> \{[Takami]}
<1158> "...Could that be?!"
<1159> \{[Rei]}
<1160> "So... you mean,
<1161> \ Like me, he was made from the blood of an Angel,
<1162> \ Copy――”
<1163> \{[Nue]}
<1164> "You're right. It's just as you imagined."
<1165> \{[Nue]}
<1166> "But let me correct you on one point.
<1167> \ You and I are not exactly the same.
<1168> \ There are some slight differences.
<1169> \{[Rei]}
<1170> "What's different...?"
<1171> \{[Takami]}
<1172> "Hey, you--!"
<1173> \{[Takami]}
<1174> "While pretending to serve my father,
<1175> \ There was someone who had been betraying my father for many years,
<1176> \ --Is that so?
<1177> \{[Nue]}
<1178> "That's right. The Kujo family has been trying to get rid of the worms in their bodies.
<1179> \ He kept it as a loyal retainer."
<1180> \{[Takami]}
<1181> "Who is it?! Who on earth is calling an Angel?!"
<1182> \ Who was continuing the research my father abandoned?
<1183> \{[Takami]}
<1184> "What's his name?
<1185> \ The traitor's true identity is――!?」
<1186> \{[Nue]}
<1187> "Head of Kujo, what do you intend to do after hearing that?"
<1188> \{[Takami]}
<1189> "Of course, traitors will be punished...!"
<1190> \{[Nue]}
<1191> "Who was that man--"
<1192> \{[Nue]}
<1193> "Now that's gone,
<1194> \ It's become something that doesn't matter to you guys."
<1195> \{[Nue]}
<1196> "He was here, just a little while ago.
<1197> \ But now it no longer exists in this world.
<1198> \{[Nue]}
<1199> "I... erased it."
<1200> \{[Takami]}
<1201> "Did you delete it...?"
<1202> \{[Nue]}
<1203> "Yes. With these hands, I will create him.
<1204> \ I erased it from this world without a trace.
<1205> \{[Nue]}
<1206> "That is the power of the Angel that I possess."
<1207> \{[Rei]}
<1208> "...!"
<1209> Unlike Rei, whose powers have yet to awaken, this young man
<1210> The power of the angel that you possess,
<1211> Are you already using it fluently?
<1212> Despite the tense atmosphere that surrounded the place,
<1213> The young man smiled quietly, his attitude full of ease and confidence.
<1214> Unexpectedly from his aristocratic and elegant appearance,
<1215> The scent of danger wafts from his entire body.
<1216> A young man who calls himself an "Angel."
<1217> It was very similar to Rei - but there was something crucially different.
<1218> There was something sinister and destructive about that gaze.
<1219> \{[Nue]}
<1220> "...Let me tell you an old story."
<1221> \{[Nue]}
<1222> "Once upon a time,
<1223> \ There was a man who was full of ambition..."
<1224> \{[Nue]}
<1225> "The man served Kujo Takahisa as a loyal subordinate,
<1226> In his heart, he felt jealousy towards Takahisa,
<1227> \ He was stained black with ambition to seize power.
<1228> \{[Nue]}
<1229> "He will give birth to angels on earth,
<1230> \ While cooperating with Takahisa's plan,
<1231> \ He was secretly looking for an opportunity to fulfil his own ambitions."
<1232> \{[Nue]}
<1233> "Takahisa, apparently for personal reasons,
<1234> \ The special power that the \<Angel\> possesses,
<1235> \ He wondered if it could be marketed as a military weapon.
<1236> \{[Nue]}
<1237> "Just by giving birth to one
<1238> \ Takahisa has stopped researching Angel clones,
<1239> \ He was dissatisfied, you seeー"
<1240> \{[Nue]}
<1241> "I secretly stole the blood of the Angel from Takahisa,
<1242> \ Research into cloning continued.
<1243> \{[Nue]}
<1244> "But he soon runs into trouble."
<1245> \{[Nue]}
<1246> "When I made Rei, it went so well,
<1247> \ Even if you continue to try to create a perfect clone like Rei,
<1248> \ Failures continued.
<1249> \{[Nue]}
<1250> "Some have no intelligence, some have no form,
<1251> \ Others are extremely fragile,
<1252> \ Some individuals died shortly after being born..."
<1253> \{[Nue]}
<1254> "However, the one trait that was common to all the clones was,
<1255> \ As it was ordained,
<1256> \ An extremely short lifespan, lasting only a few years--"
<1257> \{[Nue]}
<1258> "The Angel clones he created,
<1259> \ The telomeres that determine the lifespan of living organisms are extremely short,
<1260> \ Every single one of them is born with a shorter lifespan than humans.
<1261> \{[Rei]}
<1262> "...!"
<1263> \{[Takami]}
<1264> "Could it be that Rei is like that too?!"
<1265> \{[Nue]}
<1266> "After stealing it, the man created a clone...
<1267> \ I told you so.
<1268> \ Rei was the only one born without the fate of a short life.
<1269> \{[Rei]}
<1270> "I'm the only one..."
<1271> \{[Nue]}
<1272> "...made by culturing the original adult somatic cells,
<1273> \ Do you know the weakness of somatic cell clones?
<1274> \{[Rei]}
<1275> "...at the end of the chromosome,
<1276> \ The length of telomeres shortens with each cell division.
<1277> \ Somatic cell clones are influenced by adult cells.
<1278> \{[Rei]}
<1279> "Dolly, the famous somatic cell cloned sheep,
<1280> \ From birth, telomeres are as short as those of a six-year-old adult,
<1281> \ Apparently he showed signs of aging at the age of one.
<1282> \{[Rei]}
<1283> "So, somatic cell cloning is
<1284> \ Cells have already aged before we are born,
<1285> \ They can only live to the same age as adults..."
<1286> \{[Nue]}
<1287> "--That's right. To put it simply, somatic cell clones are,
<1288> \ They age and die sooner than naturally occurring individuals.
<1289> \{[Nue]}
<1290> "With modern cloning technology,
<1291> \ We have not yet found a way to solve this problem.
<1292> \{[Rei]}
<1293> "...The reason why Angel clones have such a short lifespan is
<1294> \ Is that the reason?
<1295> \{[Nue]}
<1296> "Noーthat only applies to terrestrial creatures."
<1297> \{[Nue]}
<1298> "If we believe Takahisa's words, an angel is,
<1299> \ A being that is almost immortal,
<1300> \ Apparently it's even possible to choose your own lifespan."
<1301> \{[Nue]}
<1302> "Then, even if you are born as a somatic cell clone,
<1303> \ Unlike humans and other terrestrial creatures,
<1304> \ It was impossible for lifespans to be so short."
<1305> \{[Nue]}
<1306> "But for some reason, the newly created clone,
<1307> \ We are all born with the fate of a short life..."
<1308> \{[Nue]}
<1309> "It's as if they're declaring that no further blasphemy will be tolerated.
<1310> \ Like a curse cast by an Angel--"
<1311> \{[Rei]}
<1312> "......"
<1313> \{[Rei]}
<1314> "There's something that's been bothering me for a while now."
<1315> \{[Rei]}
<1316> "Another Angel clone,
<1317> \ It has been said that all people are destined to have short lives,
<1318> \ So -- what about you?"
<1319> \{[Rei]}
<1320> "If you're one of the clones,
<1321> \ Like the rest of us, we were born to a short life.
<1322> \{[Rei]}
<1323> "But... seeing your age and appearance,
<1324> \ Those who have only a few years of life,
<1325> \ I don't think I can grow that much."
<1326> \{[Rei]}
<1327> "What does that look like to you mean?"
<1328> \{[Nue]}
<1329> "...After continuing my research for a while, I realized why Takahisa
<1330> \ Why not try to create a second or third clone?
<1331> \ The man learned this firsthand.
<1332> \{[Nue]}
<1333> "I'm sure that no one else will be able to successfully create a clone other than you.
<1334> \ Takahisa probably knew from the beginning..."
<1335> \{[Nue]}
<1336> "Well, the blood of that mysterious Angel,
<1337> \ It's Takahisa who came in out of nowhere.
<1338> \ It wouldn't be surprising if he knew something.

<1340> "......"
<1341> \{[Nue]}
<1342> "But even so, the military use of the power of the Angels,

<1347> \{[Nue]}
<1348> "A combination of human genes and angel genes,

<1358> "Most individuals show no signs of manifesting their powers,
<1359> Only individuals that were no different from humans were born--"
<1360> \{[Nue]}
<1361> "So, let's aim to weaponize the power of the Angels.
<1362> \ It doesn't serve the man's purpose.
<1363> \ I guess it has to be a clone..."
<1364> \{[Nue]}
<1365> "Without diminishing the power of the Angel,
<1366> \ Extend its life,
<1367> \ Continuing to seek combinations with clone individuals--"
<1368> \{[Nue]}
<1369> "What we ended up with was a mixture of Beast genes."
<1370> \{[Rei]}
<1371> "Beast genes...?"
<1372> \{[Nue]}
<1373> "And thenーI was born.
<1374> \ A mixture of angel genes and beast genes,

<1376> \{[Nue]}
<1377> "I'm not a pure Angel clone.

<1386> \{[Nue]}
<1387> "What kind of being is this 'beast'?
<1388> \ Again, like the Angel, the man does not know the details.

<1390> \{[Nue]}
<1391> "The best combination for strengthening an Angel is

<1395> "......"
<1396> \{[Nue]}
<1397> "However, the genetic defect was corrected,

<1402> \{[Nue]}
<1403> "The genes of the Angels are corrupted by the genes of the Beasts,

<1411> "In just a little while, the full-scale collapse will begin--"
<1412> \{[Nue]}
<1413> "Your life as an angel is coming to an end,

<1419> \{[Nue]}
<1420> "That's why I came here.
<1421> \ ...to welcome you."
<1422> \{[Rei]}
<1423> "To use me as research material...right?"
<1424> \{[Nue]}
<1425> "Now I long for you,

<1427> \{[Nue]}
<1428> "When you found out I was a failure,
<1429> \ He must have thought that he had no choice but to get you."
<1430> \{[Nue]}
<1431> "But my own opinion is completely different.
<1432> \ You - the Angel,
<1433> \ I have no intention of letting them get away with it."
<1434> \{[Nue]}
<1435> "I only think about using Angels as weapons,
<1436> \ That man's presence is a nuisance..."
<1437> \{[Nue]}
<1438> "So I made that man disappear."
<1439> \{[Rei]}
<1440> "What do you mean, erased?"
<1441> \{[Nue]}
<1442> "I mean it literally. Quite literally.
<1443> I "erased" that existence."

<1445> "...Let me show you.
<1446> \ The power of the Angel that I possess--"
<1447> \{[Nue]}
<1448> "Rei--can you see this?"
<1449> Behind the young man who was asking Rei a question,
<1450> Suddenly, something large and transparent appears.
<1451> \{[Rei]}
<1452> "Those are... wings...?"
<1453> Yesーit spreads across the young man's back,
<1454> It looked like a pair of black wings.
<1455> One wing alone is probably about two meters long.
<1456> Its surface, darker than night, radiates a mysterious brilliance,
<1457> The young man's back is adorned with a sinister yet elegant beauty.
<1458> It feels weightless and somewhat mirage-like.
<1459> What overwhelms those who see it is
<1460> It's not just the fantastical, long wings.
<1461> A strange wave emanates from the wings,
<1462> The air around them trembles and becomes tense.
<1463> \{[Nozomi]}
<1464> "The wings... are making a lot of noise...!"
<1465> \{[Nozomi]}
<1466> "It's like... singing..."
<1467> Gazing in awe at the jet-black shining wings,
<1468> Nozomi tells Rei with trembling lips.
<1469> \{[Nue]}
<1470> "It may look like wings growing from your back,
<1471> \ This is not exactly a physical entity.
<1472> \{[Nue]}
<1473> "The embodiment of my will,
<1474> \ A spiritual hand wielding its power to show the world my will."
<1475> \{[Nue]}
<1476> "Unable to be touched by human hands,
<1477> \ These are wings that only an angel possesses--"
<1478> \{[Nue]}
<1479> "These wings bring death to those who see them,
<1480> \ They called them the Black Wings in awe.
<1481> \{[Rei]}
<1482> “<Black Wings>――”
<1483> \{[Nue]}
<1484> "To all beings on earth,
<1485> \ The ominous black wings that bring about absolute death--"
<1486> \{[Nue]}
<1487> "Within the reach of these wings,
<1488> \ No earthly weapon can harm me."
<1489> \{[Nue]}
<1490> "Because those who touch the Black Wings,
<1491> \ Its existence will be immediately dissolved..."
<1492> \{[Rei]}
<1493> "Unravel existence?"
<1494> \{[Nue]}
<1495> "That is the power that the Black Wings bring."
<1496> \{[Nue]}
<1497> "According to the words of Kujo Takahisa, a true angel is,
<1498> \ It is said that it has the power to control both the creation and destruction of existence..."
<1499> \{[Nue]}
<1500> "Giving form to the lifeless,
<1501> \ The power to give life,
<1502> \ The power to unravel the shape of existence and return everything to nothingness--"
<1503> \{[Nue]}
<1504> "Unfortunately, I was born with only the power of destruction."
<1505> \{[Nue]}
<1506> "But you, born as a perfect replica of an Angel,
<1507> \ He must possess both of these powers."
<1508> \{[Rei]}
<1509> "The power to create existence, the power to unravel existence..."
<1510> \{[Nue]}
<1511> "When your power joins mine,
<1512> The range of the Black Wings and the power they exert are:
<1513> \ It will be even bigger and stronger."
<1514> \{[Nue]}
<1515> "The Black Wings can also change the world."
<1516> \{[Nue]}
<1517> "--Come with me, Rei."
<1518> \{[Nue]}
<1519> "If your power is added to mine, there will be no enemy on earth.
<1520> \ We can become the strongest creatures in this world."
<1521> \{[Nue]}
<1522> "The earth is a miniature garden prepared for us angels.
<1523> \ If you don't like it, just tear it down and rebuild it."
<1524> \{[Nue]}
<1525> "Destroy or toy with,
<1526> \ The world is at our fingertips.
<1527> \{[Nue]}
<1528> "Rei, in this world today and in the narrow-mindedness of human hearts,
<1529> \ You must have felt despair too."
<1530> \{[Nue]}
<1531> "Don't tell me you didn't feel it.
<1532> \ The ugliness and foolishness of the human heart,
<1533> \ You've touched me enough times now..."
<1534> \{[Rei]}
<1535> "You speak as if you've seen it before."
<1536> \{[Nue]}
<1537> "Yeah. I can feel it.
<1538> \ The loneliness, sadness, and despair that lie deep within your heart
<1539> \ I can sense it..."
<1540> \{[Rei]}
<1541> "--!"
<1542> \{[Nue]}
<1543> "You understand, don't you, Rei?
<1544> \ You and I were originally one being.
<1545> \{[Nue]}
<1546> "Your loneliness, your despair,
<1547> \ I am the only one on earth who truly understands this.
<1548> \{[Nue]}
<1549> "So――Rei,
<1550> \ Let's create the world we desire together, you and I.
<1551> \{[Nue]}
<1552> "...Destroy this world."
<1553> \{[Nue]}
<1554> "Together with me,
<1555> \ Let us witness the day of humanity's destruction--"
<1556> It is the darkest part of Rei's heart,
<1557> It was an inviting word that shook me to my core.
<1558> Seeing through the deep darkness of the human heart,
<1559> It gives strength to the quiet feelings of anger and despair that lie within,
<1560> The eyes of an angel, as if forcibly awakening.
<1561> The more I yearn to destroy the world,
<1562> The eyes of the black-winged Angel,
<1563> I wonder if he has lived his life staring into the darkness of the human heart.
<1564> If it were Rei from a short time ago, she would have been able to see the darkness in this angel's heart.
<1565> The darkness whispers an ominous invitation,
<1566> The attraction may have been so strong that it was hard to resist.
<1567> But now...
<1568> \{[Rei]}
<1569> "...It seems you can't sense it.
<1570> \ My heart is filled with more than just sadness and disappointment,
<1571> \ That it has already been fulfilledー"
<1572> \{[Rei]}
<1573> "I can't go with you.
<1574> \ Because I don't wish to destroy the world."
<1575> \{[Nue]}
<1576> "--Is it because of your boring existence?"
<1577> \{[Nue]}
<1578> "Your attachment to the human world is
<1579> \ Is it because of some fake Angel out there?
<1580> \{[Nue]}
<1581> "Then I will remove the chains that bind you to the earth,
<1582> \ I will cut it off with my own hands.
<1583> \{[Nue]}
<1584> "Turn that thing off."
<1585> \{[Rei]}
<1586> "...!"
<1587> \{[Nue]}
<1588> "If you refuse to come, I will take you by force.
<1589> \ ...cut off all your regrets."
<1590> The young man's cold declaration,
<1591> It was as if a sharp blade was being held to my neck.
<1592> A chilling tension runs through the room.
<1593> And then, at that moment.
<1594> Suddenly, the door to the entrance hall, to which the young man had turned,
<1595> It was wide open from the outside.
<1596> \{[Takami]}
<1597> "What――!?"
<1598> In front of Rei and the others, who were holding their breath, a man wearing a black bulletproof suit appeared.
<1599> Armed with automatic rifles at their hips,
<1600> About six men entered the mansion with loud footsteps.
<1601> \{[Nue]}
<1602> "Oh... what an eyesore we've got."
<1603> \{[Takami]}
<1604> "Wh-what are these guys...?!"
<1605> \{[Nue]}
<1606> "They're here to capture the Angel.
<1607> \ My owner... I guess that's what you'd call it."
<1608> \{[Nue]}
<1609> "I won't let you escape,
<1610> \ They surrounded the mansion and took control of the area.
<1611> One of the intruders, alert and ready with his rifle,
<1612> He stepped cautiously in front of the young man and questioned him in a firm voice.
<1613> \{[Man]}
<1614> "What do you mean, Nue?
<1615> \ We lost contact, so I was just keeping an eye on him..."
<1616> \{[Man]}
<1617> "Once you have secured your target, report it immediately!
<1618> \ So, where is the captain?
<1619> \{[Nue]}
<1620> "...that person, you see."
<1621> The young man just chuckled and didn't reply.
<1622> The impatient man shouts in anger.
<1623> \{[Man]}
<1624> "Why don't you answer my question...?"
<1625> \{[Nue]}
<1626> "That person is no longer here."
<1627> \{[Man]}
<1628> "He's not here...?"
<1629> \{[Nue]}
<1630> "It was getting in the way of my actions a bit - so I deleted it."
<1631> \{[Man]}
<1632> "It was deleted...?!
<1633> Y-You, you're just a monster after all...!
<1634> \{[Nue]}
<1635> "Excuse me. I'm not a monster.
<1636> \ I am an angel.
<1637> \{[Man]}
<1638> "That doesn't matter either way!
<1639> \ In any case, you are a monster, not a human being!
<1640> \{[Man]}
<1641> "A mad dog that bites its owner's hand is too dangerous!
<1642> \ You'll die, Nue--!"
<1643> He let out a cry of rage, his voice full of unconcealed fear.
<1644> The man turned on the small remote control device in his hand.
<1645> Turn it on without hesitation.
<1646> However――
<1647> Nothing happens.
<1648> \{[Man]}
<1649> "――!?"
<1650> The man's face turned pale.
<1651> He looked very confused,
<1652> Press the switch on the device over and over again.
<1653> \{[Man]}
<1654> "Why?! Why is there no reaction?
<1655> \ No way -- that's so stupid, something like this...!
<1656> \{[Nue]}
<1657> "You guys are so stupid..."
<1658> \{[Nue]}
<1659> "If you can keep me under your control forever with that device,
<1660> \ I honestly believed that--"
<1661> \{[Nue]}
<1662> "Those toys were deactivated a long time ago.
<1663> \ The power of my Black Wings,
<1664> \ It's not just about showing it to the outside world.
<1665> \{[Nue]}
<1666> "During the days when I was treated as an experimental subject,
<1667> \ There was plenty of time to sharpen his fangs and gather his strength."
<1668> \{[Nue]}
<1669> "So, you can turn your strength within yourself,
<1670> \ I tried it..."
<1671> \{[Nue]}
<1672> "The results are as you can see."
<1673> \{[Man]}
<1674> "Nue... you...!"
<1675> \{[Nue]}
<1676> "I pretended your device was effective.
<1677> \ I was just waiting for an opportunity.
<1678> \{[Nue]}
<1679> "Until now, I have only made people seek ways to prolong their lives,
<1680> \ I stayed with you--"
<1681> \{[Nue]}
<1682> "But... I don't need you guys anymore.
<1683> \ I have Rei with me.
<1684> \{[Nue]}
<1685> "Soー"
<1686> \{[Nue]}
<1687> "I'll destroy every single one of you..."
<1688> \{[Man]}
<1689> "What...?!"
<1690> \{[Nue]}
<1691> "Rei, the head of Kujo, and the fake Angel.
<1692> \ I'll show you guys.
<1693> \{[Nue]}
<1694> "A glimpse of the power of the Angels--"
<1695> On the young man's back, once again,
<1696> The wings of an angel, which he called the Black Wings, materialize.
<1697> Dark light - if there is such a thing,
<1698> This is what I think it refers to,
<1699> Jet black wings filled with a dark glow.
<1700> The folded wings slowly unfold,
<1701> The pressure released from its wings
<1702> The air around me becomes so tense that it almost makes my ears ring.
<1703> \{[Subordinate]}
<1704> "Wh-what is that...?!"
<1705> Was it the first time some of the intruders had seen this?
<1706> Suddenly appeared on the young man's back,
<1707> A voice rises in fear at the long, dark shadow.
<1708> \{[Man]}
<1709> "You guys, calm down a bit...!
<1710> \ Just stay out of range of those wings and you'll be safe!
<1711> I just pressed the switch on the remote control.
<1712> A man who appears to be a commander-class officer,
<1713> He seems to be knowledgeable about the young man's powers, as he hastily gives out instructions.
<1714> However, the strange intimidation emanating from this otherworldly being,
<1715> People who are unfamiliar with the situation feel intimidated and nervous.
<1716> \{[Nue]}
<1717> "Now, who do you want to be erased by...?"
<1718> The young man seemed to enjoy the men's fear,
<1719> The smile on his lips deepened and he whispered ominously.
<1720> It appeals to the instinct to fear heresy,
<1721> A beautiful yet sinister smile that stirs fear in the hearts of men.
<1722> \{[Subordinate]}
<1723> "Uh... Uwaaaah...!"
<1724> One of the people who could not bear the extreme tension,
<1725> In a state of near-delirium, he fired the rifle aimed at the young man.
<1726> \{[Man]}
<1727> "You idiot, don't fire yet!"
<1728> \{[Man]}
<1729> "Look closely at the color of the Black Wings!
<1730> \ Even if you shoot now, the bullets won't reach him...!"
<1731> A bullet fired at high speed from the muzzle of a rifle,
<1732> If you continue straight ahead,
<1733> It was supposed to tear the young man to shreds.
<1734> is――
<1735> \{[Subordinate]}
<1736> "The bullets... have disappeared!?"
<1737> The bullets aimed at the chest did not miss their target,
<1738> I turned towards the young man standing there with a smile on his face,
<1739> Just before that, it reached a certain point and disappeared in an instant.
<1740> \{[Subordinate]}
<1741> "That's so stupid!?"
<1742> \{[Subordinate]}
<1743> "My gun didn't work..."
<1744> The intruders, in a state of mass panic, began firing shots one after another.
<1745> They rained bullets down on the young man,
<1746> Not a single shot reaches the young man.
<1747> \{[Nue]}
<1748> "...Under these Black Wings,
<1749> \ You can't hurt me."
<1750> As the young man coldly declared with a sneer,
<1751> The bullets will not harm him.
<1752> Because the bullets fired at him
<1753> The moment I reached a point about two meters in front of the young man,
<1754> Because everything emits light and disappears.
<1755> An invisible barrier protects the young man,
<1756> Sensing the hostility directed at him,
<1757> It was a strange sight, like the bullets were being burned to ashes by an invisible flame.
<1758> \{[Subordinate]}
<1759> "Why are the bullets disappearing...?"
<1760> \{[Subordinate]}
<1761> "Ahhhh! You monster...!"
<1762> \{[Subordinate]}
<1763> "Stop it, don't come over here!"
<1764> Amid a deadly hail of gunfire,
<1765> With a cool expression, like being hit by a pleasant May shower,
<1766> The young man walked forward, maintaining a steady pace.
<1767> Like a spark that scatters in an instant,
<1768> The bullet that reached the young man's side emitted a flash of light the moment it disappeared.
<1769> Flickering in the darkness.
<1770> \{[Subordinate]}
<1771> "That's a lie..."
<1772> \{[Subordinate]}
<1773> "Don't come, don't come here!"
<1774> \{[Man]}
<1775> "You bastards...! Calm down, calm down!
<1776> \ Don't be fooled by his words!
<1777> In an attempt to calm his confused subordinates,
<1778> He gave the man who was raising his voice a cold look,
<1779> The young man muttered in a bored tone.
<1780> \{[Nue]}
<1781> "Ah, that reminds me, you're still here.
<1782> \ Someone who might get in my way."
<1783> \{[Man]}
<1784> "...!"
<1785> \{[Nue]}
<1786> "The field I was deployed to was always,
<1787> \ Attempt to invade alone and eliminate everyone there,
<1788> \ It was all covert mopping-up operations."
<1789> \{[Nue]}
<1790> "With people from other teams,
<1791> \ I have never acted together with him..."
<1792> \{[Nue]}
<1793> "Those who know the details of how the Black Wings are activated,
<1794> \ Only those involved at command level--"
<1795> \{[Nue]}
<1796> "So, besides you, there is no one else here.
<1797> \ No one knows the details of my powers."
<1798> \{[Nue]}
<1799> "So... if I erase you,
<1800> \ The rest are just a bunch of rabble."
<1801> \{[Nue]}
<1802> "If the device that was supposed to control me doesn't work,
<1803> \ You have no way of controlling me--"
<1804> \{[Man]}
<1805> "--!"
<1806> \{[Man]}
<1807> "Shoot, shoot, shoot...!
<1808> \ Keep firing until those Black Wings disappear!
<1809> A man's cry was the signal,
<1810> The shooting, which had stopped for a moment, resumes...
<1811> As expected, the young man will not be harmed.
<1812> The flash of a muzzle flash,
<1813> The bullets that were spat out scattered in front of the young man, and the light disappeared.
<1814> Instantly illuminates the world on a moonlit night.
<1815> \{[Nue]}
<1816> "...That's pointless. With this level of firepower,
<1817> \ My power cannot be defeated."
<1818> \{[Nue]}
<1819> "I'm tired of putting up with your farce.
<1820> \ -- I'll have you disappear."
<1821> The young man kicked the floor,
<1822> In an instant, he leaps into the midst of the intruders.
<1823> \{[Man]}
<1824> "What...?!"
<1825> \{[Subordinate]}
<1826> "Fast...!"
<1827> The movement was so agile,
<1828> Before they could escape, several of the intruders
<1829> He is drawn into a space dominated by young people.
<1830> The man giving instructions to his subordinates,
<1831> He was among those few.
<1832> \{[Nue]}
<1833> "Well... I got him."
<1834> What will happen? Rei and the others watch with bated breath.
<1835> The men, ready to fire their guns, stop moving.
<1836> \{[Man]}
<1837> "Ah... ah..."
<1838> \{[Subordinate]}
<1839> "...I can't...move."
<1840> Humans who are drawn into the sphere of control of the Black Wings,
<1841> As if trapped by invisible arms,
<1842> Will you be bound by power and unable to move?
<1843> \{[Man]}
<1844> "Help me...!"
<1845> Her eyes widened in fear and she let out a hoarse scream,
<1846> The man appears frozen in place, unable to move.
<1847> \{[Nue]}
<1848> "That's a shame... Farewell."
<1849> As the young man said his farewell,
<1850> The bodies of the man and his subordinates
<1851> Just like the bullet that disappeared before the young man, he was enveloped in light.
<1852> And thenーslowly,
<1853> The men disappear into the light.
<1854> People, things, everything,
<1855> Slowly - until it becomes a fragment of light,
<1856> Its existence is unravelled and it disappears.
<1857> \{[Man]}
<1858> "All of me... will be returned to the light..."
<1859> Unable to escape the control of the Black Wings, he was enveloped in a white light.
<1860> All existence is reduced to light――
<1861> Theyーthey vanished.
<1862> \{[Takami]}
<1863> "What on earth is going on...?"
<1864> Perhaps he had heard Takami's stunned muttering words,
<1865> A young man with his wings spread wide answers.
<1866> \{[Nue]}
<1867> "What is the power of the Black Wings?
<1868> \ I myself, who exercise it, don't know for sure.
<1869> \{[Nue]}
<1870> "Take people and things under your wings,
<1871> \ The power of an Angel that can even unravel into light..."
<1872> \{[Nue]}
<1873> "The power to transform the very source of existence--"
<1874> \{[Nue]}
<1875> "This world and the beings in it,
<1876> \ The power to unravel the laws of causality--"
<1877> \{[Nue]}
<1878> "Well, I guess this power is something like that.
<1879> \ I'm thinking.
<1880> \{[Rei]}
<1881> "Unraveling the causal laws of existence..."
<1882> The power released from the Black Wings,
<1883> The very foundations of our existence that are necessary for us to exist in this world are shaken,
<1884> Disconnected from the world and disappearing.
<1885> Rearranging molecular structures,
<1886> It takes place on a level far beyond that.
<1887> Rewriting of existence information――
<1888> Indeed, this can only be described as the power of an angel.
<1889> It is a power from a heretical realm that is beyond human control.
<1890> \{[Nue]}
<1891> "Now, the rest of you,
<1892> \ I'll untie you all and erase you from this world."
<1893> \{[Subordinate]}
<1894> "Hi...!"
<1895> The battle between the young man and the intruder that followed was
<1896> The situation became one-sided.
<1897> The invaders' attacks were completely unsuccessful.
<1898> The young man's wings flutter, and each time the figure disappears into the light.
<1899> Fascinated by the overwhelming power wielded by a young man calling himself Nue,
<1900> He taps Nozomi on the shoulder, who is pale and stunned, and whispers.
<1901> \{[Rei]}
<1902> "Let's go, Nozomi. Come on -- Takami, you have to pull yourself together."
<1903> Without losing his composure, he was suddenly brought back to his senses by Rei's quiet words,
<1904> The two men's eyes are fixed on Rei.
<1905> \{[Rei]}
<1906> "Let's get out of here while they're still dealing with this."
<1907> The two of them nodded back silently,
<1908> Leaving the intruder screaming and firing,
<1909> I left the place in a hurry.
<1910> With only the faint moonlight to guide us,
<1911> Rei, Nozomi and Takami,
<1912> Continue running down the hallway as fast as you can.
<1913> \{[Takami]}
<1914> "Rei! Where are you going!?"
<1915> \{[Rei]}
<1916> "The main exit from the mansion has likely been captured earlier.
<1917> \ We must find another way out..."
<1918> \{[Takami]}
<1919> "Then let's escape through that window!
<1920> \ This is the first floor, so there's no danger if you jump off.
<1921> \{[Takami]}
<1922> "If the power is off and security is disabled,
<1923> \ The windows are unlocked!"
<1924> I jumped into the nearest door,
<1925> Takami immediately rushes to the large window facing the garden.
<1926> \{[Takami]}
<1927> "...It's no good, it won't open!?"
<1928> Rei also helped out, and the two of them tried many times,
<1929> The window won't open.
<1930> \{[Rei]}
<1931> "...draw power from an external source,
<1932> \ Maybe they've taken over the museum's systems."
<1933> \{[Takami]}
<1934> "Damn it...!!"
<1935> \{[Rei]}
<1936> "Takami, in this mansion,
<1937> \ Is there anything that can be used as a weapon?
<1938> \{[Takami]}
<1939> "Even if it's called a weapon... against someone like that,
<1940> \ What weapon in the world would work against it?"
<1941> \{[Rei]}
<1942> "That's true..."
<1943> \{[Rei]}
<1944> "But even so, rather than remaining bare-handed,
<1945> \ It's probably a little better.
<1946> \ Let's search for an exit and find something that could be used as a weapon."
<1947> \{[Takami]}
<1948> "Got it...!"
<1949> Butーsoon after, the gunfire stopped,
<1950> The mansion was once again enveloped in silence.
<1951> \{[Takami]}
<1952> "--! Could it be that guy--!?
<1953> \ Have you already defeated that many people by yourself?
<1954> \{[Rei]}
<1955> "Only five minutes have passed since then,
<1956> \ This leaves no time to come up with a countermeasure..."
<1957> \{[Hope]}
<1958> "--Ah! That person has come...!"
<1959> When I turned around after hearing Nozomi's words, I sensed a young man approaching in the distance.
<1960> \{[Takami]}
<1961> "Damn it...!"
<1962> \{[Takami]}
<1963> "Rei, you run!"
<1964> Takami shouted sharply at Rei, then took out a gun from his pocket.
<1965> He aimed the gun at the young man.
<1966> \{[Rei]}
<1967> "What are you going to do?"
<1968> \{[Takami]}
<1969> "...I'll hold him back."
<1970> \{[Rei]}
<1971> "Just one pistol? That's ridiculous...!"
<1972> \{[Rei]}
<1973> "Did you see it too?
<1974> \ You know guns don't work on him!"
<1975> \{[Takami]}
<1976> "--Just run away and ignore me!"
<1977> To the approaching youth,
<1978> Takami swallowed hard and pulled the trigger.
<1979> However――
<1980> The young man spread his black wings,
<1981> He blocks all of Takami's bullets.
<1982> \{[Takami]}
<1983> "Damn it...! It's not working after all...!"
<1984> Takami, who had fired all the bullets in his gun,
<1985> I hastily took out a spare magazine from my pocket,
<1986> Attempts to reload.
<1987> However, while Takami was struggling with the unfamiliar controls,
<1988> The young man, having erased his Black Wings, sprints off.
<1989> \{[Rei]}
<1990> "Takami, it's dangerous--!"
<1991> \{[Takami]}
<1992> "What...?!"
<1993> Takami suddenly raised his head, and without slowing down his charge,
<1994> The young man catches it in his raised hand.
<1995> And just like that,
<1996> He grabbed Takami's head and slammed it against the wall.
<1997> \{[Takami]}
<1998> "Guah--"
<1999> \{[Rei]}
<2000> "Takami...!"
<2001> I slowly leaned myself against the wall,
<2002> Takami's body collapses.
<2003> Takami collapses to the floor and lies there, not moving a muscle.
<2004> Appears to be completely unconscious.
<2005> As if losing interest, she let go of Takami's hand,
<2006> The young man gazes at Rei,
<2007> Once again, it slowly comes towards me.
<2008> \{[Nue]}
<2009> "Rei...don't reject me."
<2010> \{[Nue]}
<2011> "If you refuse, I will
<2012> \ You'll have to do something terrible..."
<2013> I'm worried about Takami, who has fallen and is not moving.
<2014> There's nothing I can do about it now.
<2015> While Rei is distracting the young man and leaving the scene,
<2016> All I can do is pray that I wake up and escape.
<2017> \{[Rei]}
<2018> "--Let's go, Nozomi!"
<2019> Rei holds Nozomi's hand tightly,
<2020> He turned his back on the young man chasing him and started running.
<2021> I ran as hard as I could, thinking of a way to escape,
<2022> There just wasn't enough time to do anything.
<2023> The presence behind Rei was chasing her, gradually closing the distance.
<2024> I don't even need to look back to confirm it.
<2025> At the very least, I'd jump into one of the rooms and barricade myself in.
<2026> Is there any way to buy time?
<2027> \{[Nue]}
<2028> "At this moment when you corner your prey,
<2029> \ My heart is always excited,
<2030> \ It's about time we put an end to our play..."
<2031> Hearing the young man's voice unexpectedly close,
<2032> Rei feels a sense of unrest in her heart.
<2033> \{[Rei]}
<2034> “Nozomi…!”
<2035> Sensing a murderous intent, he hastily pulled Nozomi's body towards him,
<2036> The breathless Nozomi runs to the spot where
<2037> With just that, the young man's weapon-like arm swiftly escapes.
<2038> The two of them rolled to the floor, and at their feet,
<2039> A smiling young man stands in front of me.
<2040> \{[Nue]}
<2041> "Rei, your physical abilities are no different from those of a human."
<2042> \{[Nue]}
<2043> "But I'm different. I have the Beast's genes in me.
<2044> \ He gave me physical abilities superior to those of humans.
<2045> \{[Nue]}
<2046> "So... this kind of thing is possible."
<2047> The fingers, which looked just as delicate and weak as Rei's, grabbed him by the collar,
<2048> He easily drags Rei's body, which has not changed in height, up to his feet.
<2049> \{[Rei]}
<2050> "Ugh--!"
<2051> \{[Nue]}
<2052> "Look... I got it."
<2053> The young man's fingers gripped his collar, immobilizing him.
<2054> Rei's body is lifted high.
<2055> \{[Rei]}
<2056> "Ugh..."
<2057> Hanging from the young man's arms, he was squeezed to the point of suffocation.
<2058> Rei's vision becomes dark.
<2059> \{[Hope]}
<2060> "Please let go of Rei...!"
<2061> In the corner of my blurred vision,
<2062> Clinging to the arms of the young man who was lifting Rei, she cried out,
<2063> Nozomi's figure appears on the screen.
<2064> \{[Rei]}
<2065> "Nozomi..."
<2066> \{[Nue]}
<2067> "......"
<2068> The arm that was holding my collar was suddenly released,
<2069> Rei's body was suddenly dropped to the ground,
<2070> Unable to even take a defensive position, he is thrown to the floor.
<2071> Rei was coughing and breathing heavily when she heard
<2072> A cold voice reached him.
<2073> \{[Nue]}
<2074> "You should have dealt with that child first..."
<2075> \{[Rei]}
<2076> "...Run... Nozomi!"
<2077> Fighting against dizziness, I managed to pull myself up by holding onto the wall.
<2078> Rei tells Nozomi.
<2079> \{[Nozomi]}
<2080> "No, I can't leave Rei behind...!"
<2081> \{[Rei]}
<2082> "The one whose life is in danger is... you!
<2083> \ It's fine for me... just you can escape...!"
<2084> \{[Nozomi]}
<2085> "No...!"
<2086> \{[Nue]}
<2087> "It's a small token of mercy. I hope you won't suffer.
<2088> \ With my Black Wings, I will erase your existence from the face of the earth."
<2089> A faint smile graced the young man's face as he coldly spoke,
<2090> Slowlyーa pitch black shadow emerges.
<2091> The power of the Wings of Ruin that erases existence,
<2092> Attacks Nozomi.
<2093> \{[Hope]}
<2094> "Sound...!"
<2095> \{[Rei]}
<2096> “Nozomi…!”
<2097> Trapped by the power unleashed by the Black Wings,
<2098> Nozomi is unable to move from there.
<2099> Rei also feels the invisible pressure caused by the power of the Black Wings.
<2100> He is held down and his movements become slow.
<2101> The power of the Angels is concentrated at one point,
<2102> When the existence of hope becomes the focus of power,
<2103> That existence was meant to be unwound into light.
<2104> But――
<2105> \{[hope]}
<2106> "Uh... me...?"
<2107> \{[Rei]}
<2108> "It won't go away...?"
<2109> A wave of light that shakes the very foundations of existence,
<2110> After it finally calmed down,
<2111> A young man was staring at Nozomi with a surprised expression.
<2112> \{[Nue]}
<2113> "This is... surprising.
<2114> \ The power of the Black Wings doesn't work on you."
<2115> \{[Nue]}
<2116> "Although it is only a little,
<2117> \ As expected of someone of Angelic blood.
<2118> \{[Nue]}
<2119> "Resonating with the sound of the Black Wings,
<2120> \ Can we neutralize the power being released...?
<2121> \{[Nue]}
<2122> "But even if the power of the Black Wings doesn't reach you,
<2123> \ Taking the life of one helpless human being is an easy thing to do."
<2124> \{[Nue]}
<2125> "I will kill you with my own hands."
<2126> \{[Nozomi]}
<2127> "Ah..."
<2128> \{[Rei]}
<2129> "Don't lay a hand on Nozomi..."
<2130> \{[Nue]}
<2131> "Rei - You, who have not yet awakened to the blood of an Angel,
<2132> \ You're not my enemy."
<2133> \{[Nue]}
<2134> "Without being able to do anything,
<2135> \ You should just stay there and watch quietly."
<2136> \{[Nue]}
<2137> "This boy was killed by my hands,
<2138> \ The end..."
<2139> \{[Rei]}
<2140> "Stop it...! Nozomi, I'm fine,
<2141> \ You need to run away quickly!!"
<2142> \{[Nozomi]}
<2143> "No...!"
<2144> \{[Rei]}
<2145> "Nozomi, listen to what I say!"
<2146> \{[Nozomi]}
<2147> "I don't want to run away and leave you behind...!"
<2148> \{[Rei]}
<2149> “Nozomi…!”
<2150> \{[Nue]}
<2151> "...That's quite brave. But unfortunately,
<2152> \ Those feelings will never be reciprocated."
<2153> \{[Nue]}
<2154> "I'll take Rei."
<2155> It must have been hidden in the cuff of the young man's arm, and with a flick of the young man's arm,
<2156> A thin, sharp knife appears at his fingertips.
<2157> \{[Rei]}
<2158> "--!"
<2159> Realizing the intention of the young man approaching Nozomi with a knife in his hand,
<2160> Rei is overcome with fear, as if an icy hand is gripping her heart.
<2161> He touched Nozomi's chest from behind.
<2162> I'm going to stab you with that knife.
<2163> \{[Rei]}
<2164> "Stop it!"
<2165> \{[Rei]}
<2166> "I'll follow your word, so don't lay a hand on Nozomi!
<2167> \ Stop hurting Nozomi...!"
<2168> \{[Nue]}
<2169> "...I never thought you'd say something like that.
<2170> \ You've become quite attached to just one human being."
<2171> \{[Nue]}
<2172> "--It's an eyesore."
<2173> With a cold word and a careless stab,
<2174> The slender blade sinks deep into Nozomi's back.
<2175> \{[Hope]}
<2176> "Ah..."
<2177> With a sigh that seemed to be forced from his chest,
<2178> Her weak, delicate body slowly collapses to the floor.
<2179> \{[Rei]}
<2180> “Nozomi――――!”
<2181> \{[Nue]}
<2182> "It's okay. I'm still breathing."
<2183> \{[Nue]}
<2184> "At your request, I avoided the vital points.
<2185> \ It's not a fatal wound, so with any luck you should survive."
<2186> \{[Nue]}
<2187> "But I wonder if help will arrive in time before he loses too much blood.
<2188> \ I don't know that much either."
<2189> \{[Nozomi]}
<2190> "...Rei...sa..."
<2191> Crouched and trembling, Nozomi's lips had lost all blood.
<2192> He calls out Rei's name in a husky voice.
<2193> \{[Rei]}
<2194> “Nozomi…!”
<2195> As if blocking Rei's view as she desperately searches for Nozomi,
<2196> The young man looked at Rei and said.
<2197> \{[Nue]}
<2198> "Now... I want you to keep your promise."
<2199> \{[Rei]}
<2200> "After I rescued Nozomi--!"
<2201> \{[Nue]}
<2202> "Did you make concessions?
<2203> \ I gave them a chance to survive.
<2204> \{[Nue]}
<2205> "I don't want to hurt you. I don't want you to get too worked up, so
<2206> \ I'm going to let you sleep for a while."
<2207> A cloth soaked in some kind of chemical was tightly pressed against my mouth.
<2208> Unable to resist, she is forced to drink the drug.
<2209> The strong smell of chemicals made me dizzy,
<2210> My whole body was relaxed.
<2211> My consciousness sinks helplessly into darkness.
<2212> \{[Nue]}
<2213> "Good night... Rei. The next time I wake up,
<2214> \ You're mine now--"
<2215> As my consciousness fades, I sense a ripple of laughter.
<2216> It echoed in Rei's ears forever.
<2217> \{[???]}
<2218> "I don't want to do anything more cruel to you than that.
<2219> \ Please stop!
<2220> \{[???]}
<2221> "I won't let anyone lay a hand on you two...!"
<2222> The girl's voice echoes through the dark corridor.
<2223> \{[Nue]}
<2224> "...Who are you?"
<2225> \{[Mari]}
<2226> "If you intend to lay a hand on the two of them any further,
<2227> \ I'll be your opponent...!
<2228> \{[Rei]}
<2229> "Mari! Are you okay?"
<2230> \{[Mari]}
<2231> "Sorry I'm late, Rei-sama...!"
<2232> \{[Mari]}
<2233> "I was out the whole time trying to arrange for a car,
<2234> \ I was late in noticing the strange happenings at the mansion.
<2235> \{[Mari]}
<2236> "Are you injured?
<2237> \ We will help you immediately...!"
<2238> \{[Rei]}
<2239> "! Don't come over here!
<2240> \ You alone must escape from this mansion!
<2241> \{[Mari]}
<2242> "Protecting Rei-sama is
<2243> \ It's an important mission that I decided on myself."
<2244> \{[Mari]}
<2245> "I will protect you!"
<2246> \{[Mari]}
<2247> "I have your protection,
<2248> \ Because we have the “power”
<2249> \{[Rei]}
<2250> “Power…”
<2251> \{[Mari]}
<2252> "For example... this kind of power!"
<2253> As she cried out, Marie placed one hand on the wall nearby,
<2254> Close your eyes and concentrate.
<2255> At that moment, the wall began to undulate as if it were a living thing.
<2256> Countless thorny tendrils sprang out from it.
<2257> \{[Nue]}
<2258> "――――!"
<2259> The thorny vines all attacked the young man at once.
<2260> It appears to be made of very hard and sharp steel.
<2261> When it hit the floor or the opposite wall, it easily punched through it.
<2262> The young man spread his black wings and quickly dodged the attack.
<2263> Using his strength, he catches the steel thorns that attack him one after the other and unravels them into light.
<2264> Marie didn't give the young man any time to rest.
<2265> Now place your hands on the floor and focus your attention there.
<2266> Like a cage that traps a beast,
<2267> Steel pillars spring up from the floor, surrounding and trapping the young man.
<2268> \{[Nue]}
<2269> "This is...!"
<2270> The power of the young man's Black Wings returned the pillar to light just a little faster.
<2271> The ceiling was broken through by pillars.
<2272> It collapses into a large boulder on top of the young man.
<2273> \{[Nue]}
<2274> "--!"
<2275> The ceiling collapsed, causing dust to fly up.
<2276> The view beyond is obscured, as if by a thin film.
<2277> --A brief silence descends upon the place.
<2278> Eventually, when the veil of darkness is lifted,
<2279> A young man appears on the other side.
<2280> Cancel all of Marie's attacks,
<2281> It also supports and unravels the huge mass that has collapsed.
<2282> Such a bold move in such a short time,
<2283> The young man must have made full use of the power of the Black Wings to accomplish this.
<2284> \{[Nue]}
<2285> "...What is it, you?"
<2286> \{[Nue]}
<2287> "Your power is equal to that of an Angel, right?"
<2288> \{[Nue]}
<2289> "But besides Kujo Takahisa and that man,
<2290> \ To think that there is a human being who has obtained the blood of an Angel,
<2291> \ I haven't been told--"
<2292> \{[Nue]}
<2293> "Who created you, an angel?"
<2294> \{[Mari]}
<2295> "...I have no intention of answering that question."
<2296> \{[Rei]}
<2297> "Mari... what about you...?"
<2298> \{[Mari]}
<2299> "I amーI am your protector."
<2300> \{[Mari]}
<2301> "To repay the kindness you showed me long ago,
<2302> \ I've come to your side.
<2303> \{[Nue]}
<2304> "...Interesting. Instead of Rei,
<2305> \ You say you'll fight me?
<2306> \{[Nue]}
<2307> "I don't know how much power it has,
<2308> \ Then, I'll have you be my partner."
<2309> \{[Nue]}
<2310> "I'd like to see what you can do!"
<2311> The knife hidden in the cuff of the young man's arm snapped open,
<2312> It appears at your fingertips.
<2313> The young man kicked the floor and approached,
<2314> He threw the knife sharply at Marie.
<2315> Marie dodged the knife that came at her like a flash of light, but
<2316> Taking advantage of this opportunity, the young man closes in on them.
<2317> \{[Mari]}
<2318> "Ugh--!"
<2319> In response to the barrage of attacks on the young man earlier,
<2320> Perhaps he was concentrating and putting in a lot of effort.
<2321> Marie's movements have visibly slowed down.
<2322> Before I could dodge,
<2323> The young man easily jumped into Marie's arms.
<2324> I hastily stepped back, and Marie stretched out her arm to touch the wall.
<2325> He raised his palm strike, ready to strike from his hip, and deflected it.
<2326> The young man delivered a mid-level kick to Marie's stomach.
<2327> \{[Mari]}
<2328> "Ahhh..."
<2329> The kick knocked me off my body, and my back slammed into the wall.
<2330> Marie crouches on the floor and coughs.
<2331> The young man slowly approaches Marie, who is lying on the ground.
<2332> \{[Nozomi]}
<2333> "Don't do anything terrible to Marie...!"
<2334> The small stone that Nozomi threw,
<2335> It hit the young man's back with a thud and fell to the floor.
<2336> \{[Nue]}
<2337> "...What are you?"
<2338> The young man's body is barely able to be touched by bullets.
<2339> The pebble I threw in my excitement hit something.
<2340> Nozomi, the one who threw it, flinches back in surprise.
<2341> \{[Nue]}
<2342> "Are you trying to get in my way?
<2343> \ Even though you're a weak being――」
<2344> \{[Nozomi]}
<2345> "Ah..."
<2346> \{[Rei]}
<2347> "--Don't get close to Nozomi."
<2348> Protecting the paralyzed hope,
<2349> Rei stands between the young man's gaze and Nozomi.
<2350> \{[Mari]}
<2351> "Rei-sama, Nozomu-san, please step back...!"
<2352> I crouched down and touched the wall and floor,
<2353> The being changes according to Marie's will.
<2354> The walls of thorns stretched out in layers, ten and twenty,
<2355> Completely block the hallway from ceiling to floor.
<2356> The young man stands in his way, hidden behind the thorns.
<2357> \{[Mari]}
<2358> "This should buy us some time.
<2359> \ Come on... let's get out of here while we can!
<2360> Marie stood up, staggering a little,
<2361> He led Rei and Nozomi out and ran.
<2362> \{[Nue]}
<2363> "...There's no point in running away, Rei.
<2364> \ I'll catch up with you soon."
<2365> \{[Nue]}
<2366> "Now, how far will you guys go with me?
<2367> \ Can you resist...?
<2368> From the other side of the thorn wall, I sense the young man's cold laughter.
<2369> It gradually became more distant.
<2370> The young man still wasn't taking Rei and the others seriously.
<2371> Fortunately, there was no sign of them cornering us.
<2372> This is the time when he shows his composure and doesn't attack with all his might.
<2373> This is probably one of the few chances of victory given to Rei and the others.
<2374> Before the young man was ready,
<2375> We must find a way to turn the tide.
<2376> \{[Rei]}
<2377> (However... if there is no way to deal with the Black Wings,
<2378> \ You can't escape him.)
<2379> \{[Rei]}
<2380> (What should I do...?)
<2381> \{[Mari]}
<2382> "Rei-sama, Nozomi-san,
<2383> \ Please come here!
<2384> I entered one of the doors along the long corridor.
<2385> Marie beckoned the two into her room.
<2386> The mysterious power that the young man called the power of an angel,
<2387> Marie showed how easy it was to use.
<2388> Who exactly is she?
<2389> For just a moment, Rei hesitated about what to do,
<2390> Seeing Marie's face, who is still trying her best to save Rei and Nozomi,
<2391> Any doubts about his heart will disappear.
<2392> Whatever Marie's true identity,
<2393> The sincerity and sincerity that the girl has shown to Rei and Nozomi up until now,
<2394> I felt I could trust him.
<2395> \{[Rei]}
<2396> "...I'm on my way."
<2397> Rei also entered the room as Marie called him.
<2398> \{[Mari]}
<2399> "Rei-sama, please come to my side."
<2400> As if encouraged by a sincere gaze,
<2401> Rei approaches Marie.
<2402> \{[Mari]}
<2403> "I have always had the gift that Rei-sama had entrusted to me,
<2404> \ I have something very important."
<2405> \{[Mari]}
<2406> "To give it back,
<2407> \ I have come to see you once more..."
<2408> \{[Rei]}
<2409> "One more time...?"
<2410> \{[Mari]}
<2411> "Rei-sama doesn't remember,
<2412> \ We met a long time ago."
<2413> \{[Rei]}
<2414> "--What does that mean?"
<2415> \{[Mari]}
<2416> "Someday, Rei-sama,
<2417> \ I'm glad you remember me..."
<2418> Marie just smiled gently,
<2419> It seemed he had no intention of giving Rei an answer just yet.
<2420> \{[Mari]}
<2421> "By returning what you have entrusted to us,
<2422> \ The power of the angel within Rei-sama will awaken.
<2423> \{[Rei]}
<2424> "! Marie, that means--"
<2425> \{[Rei]}
<2426> "You awakened the power of the angel that lies dormant within me,
<2427> \ Does that mean it gives you the strength to fight?
<2428> \{[Mari]}
<2429> "Yes, that's right...!"
<2430> \{[Mari]}
<2431> "Then I'll give it back to you."
<2432> \{[Mari]}
<2433> "For a long, long time...
<2434> \ What I have entrusted to you--"
<2435> \{[Mari]}
<2436> "Now... Rei-sama, please close your eyes."
<2437> As she closed her eyes as instructed,
<2438> I feel the soft touch of warm human skin.
<2439> Marie's forehead was pressed against his own,
<2440> Rei realized this the next moment.
<2441> From where Marie touched,
<2442> Like opening a sealed box, something inside meーmy sensesーopened up.
<2443> \{[Rei]}
<2444> "--!"
<2445> From the opened place, towards Rei's inner self,
<2446> Something emitting a dazzling light slowly pours in.
<2447> And then, the voice from Marie's heart said,
<2448> It echoed in Rei's mind.
<2449> \{[Mari]}
<2450> "The power of the Angel that is filled in the vessel that is me,
<2451> \ Now to youーeverything.”
<2452> \{[Mari]}
<2453> "I'll give it back..."
<2454> \{[Rei]}
<2455> "Mari...!?"
<2456> A flood of sparkling sound, played by the shimmering waves of light,
<2457> The waves surged against Rei's chest.
<2458> And like water poured into a vessel,
<2459> The light fills the heart and overflows, resonating majestically.
<2460> Like a wind blowing across the earth,
<2461> As if enveloped in light pouring down from the heavens,
<2462> A vivid, cool, and difficult sensation fills my body.
<2463> Every inch of your body, even your fingertips,
<2464> I feel a strange sensation, as if I am immersed in the vibrations of light.
<2465> \{[Mari]}
<2466> "...I certainly did return it..."
<2467> The words contained a tone of satisfaction, and I sought out Marie,
<2468> My entire consciousness is consumed by a pure white light, and I can't see anything.
<2469> In the swaying of pure white light,
<2470> Only the gentle voice that comes from Marie's heart resonates peacefully.
<2471> \{[Mari]}
<2472> "Thank you for everything until today, Rei-sama..."
<2473> \{[Mari]}
<2474> "Now you have regained the power of an angel that you once lost.
<2475> \ Everything will be taken back..."
<2476> \{[Mari]}
<2477> "The power of the Angel is within you.
<2478> \ Please...don't forget that."
<2479> \{[Rei]}
<2480> "Mari..."
<2481> \{[Mari]}
<2482> "Well, this is where we say goodbye.
<2483> \ I will return to where I belong--"
<2484> \{[Mari]}
<2485> "Thanks to Rei-sama,
<2486> \ I was so happy...!
<2487> \{[Mari]}
<2488> "Thank you, Rei-sama..."
<2489> \{[Mari]}
<2490> "I hope... you'll be happy..."
<2491> And so, leaving behind a lot of dazzling light in Rei,
<2492> Marie quietly left Rei's heart.
<2493> \{[Rei]}
<2494> "Mari...!"
<2495> Calling his name, I opened my eyes, blurred by the afterimage of light,
<2496> Just as I had expected, Marie was not there.
<2497> However, Marie left Rei behind,
<2498> I can truly feel the pulse of the living Angelic power in my heart.
<2499> The feeling of power permeates every corner of me.
<2500> \{[Rei]}
<2501> (What is this... this unprecedented feeling of fullness...)
<2502> \{[Rei]}
<2503> (This is what Marie gave me back,
<2504> Is this the power of an Angel that I once possessed...?
<2505> Suddenly, everything in this world,
<2506> Fragments of light - that is, the information that constitutes its existence,
<2507> I realized it was taking shape.
<2508> Rei has had this since she was a child.
<2509> Touching the fragments of light emitted by human thoughts,
<2510> The ability to read that information--
<2511> The power of the humble rei to touch the hearts of people,
<2512> The youth's power to unravel existence,
<2513> Essentially, they are the same thing.
<2514> Rei's powers only allow him to read a portion of the information.
<2515> The difference is that the young man's power has reached the stage of unraveling existence.
<2516> \{[Rei]}
<2517> (The stage of expression is different,
<2518> \ My power, the power of that young man, and Marie's power,
<2519> \ They're all different aspects of the same power...)
<2520> \{[Rei]}
<2521> (And then, having received Marie's power,
<2522> \ Now, just like Marie,
<2523> \ It is now possible to exercise power...)
<2524> \{[Rei]}
<2525> (I can understand this with a newfound sense.
<2526> \ Now I know how to use my power.
<2527> \{[Rei]}
<2528> (With this power, I must fight.
<2529> \ ...to win)
<2530> \{[Nozomi]}
<2531> "Rei-san...!
<2532> \ Marie-san... has disappeared...!"
<2533> \{[Rei]}
<2534> "No. Marie didn't disappear.
<2535> \ Marie has returned...
<2536> \{[Rei]}
<2537> "Entrust me with the power of the Angel, and enter the light..."
<2538> \{[Nozomi]}
<2539> "I returned to the light..."
<2540> \{[Rei]}
<2541> (Mari... who were you?
<2542> \ I don't know)
<2543> \{[Rei]}
<2544> (But this power you gave me,
<2545> \ I'll never waste it...)
<2546> \{[Nozomi]}
<2547> "Ah――!"
<2548> \{[Nozomi]}
<2549> "That person is coming...!"
<2550> The young man recovered from the wounds he received from Marie's attack,
<2551> Perhaps he was following Rei.
<2552> Sensing the approaching presence of ill fortune,
<2553> Nozomi stiffens in tension.
<2554> \{[Rei]}
<2555> "...Let's go."
<2556> \{[Nozomi]}
<2557> "What are you going to do...?"
<2558> \{[Rei]}
<2559> "Fight him."
<2560> Now that Rei has acquired the same Angelic powers as Marie,
<2561> Unlock the window,
<2562> It is now possible to escape from the building.
<2563> But even if you manage to escape from the mansion,
<2564> As long as that young man lives,
<2565> Rei will continue to be targeted as an Angel.
<2566> If I don't fight the young man here and defeat him,
<2567> True freedom will never come to Rei.
<2568> Soーwe must fight him.
<2569> \{[Rei]}
<2570> "...In the fight between Marie and him that I just saw,
<2571> \ I saw a hint."
<2572> \{[Rei]}
<2573> "Yes... I learned something thanks to you."
<2574> \{[Nozomi]}
<2575> "My...?"
<2576> \{[Rei]}
<2577> "Just now, in the scene where Marie was fighting him,
<2578> \ When Marie was in danger, you threw pebbles at her.
<2579> \{[Nozomi]}
<2580> "Ah... yes. I got carried away..."
<2581> The pebble that Nozomi threw to help Marie
<2582> At that time, without being annihilated by the power of the Black Wings,
<2583> It fell at the young man's feet.
<2584> Why, at that particular time,
<2585> Didn't the young man use his Black Wings to make the pebble disappear?
<2586> "Look closely at the color of the Black Wings," he cried.
<2587> The commander of the invaders, who knows about the power of the youth...
<2588> Cancel all of Marie's attacks,
<2589> Furthermore, after supporting and unraveling the collapsing wall,
<2590> The Black Wings have vanished and never reappeared.
<2591> It wasn't that the thing I threw was special,
<2592> What if the timing of the throwing mattered?
<2593> \{[Rei]}
<2594> "During that battle, the Black Wings he activated were
<2595> \ It was long gone when you threw the pebble at it."
<2596> \{[Nozomi]}
<2597> "Yes... that's right."
<2598> \{[Rei]}
<2599> "...Perhaps the power of the Black Wings to unravel existence,
<2600> \ The amount of information that can be processed in one manifestation,
<2601> \ Isn't there a limit to that?
<2602> \{[Rei]}
<2603> "When the amount of information that can be processed at once exceeds the limit,
<2604> \ Counterbalanced with the information to be processed,
<2605> \ I think the Black Wings will be de-manifested and disappear."
<2606> \{[Rei]}
<2607> "And one more thing--"
<2608> \{[Rei]}
<2609> "The Black Wings that disappeared at the end of the battle with Marie,
<2610> \ He never expanded it again."
<2611> \{[Rei]}
<2612> "The Black Wings, which had reached their limit and disappeared,
<2613> \ Until the next activation,
<2614> \ It may take some time..."
<2615> \{[Rei]}
<2616> "In an instant, a being with mass beyond the limit,
<2617> \ If you clash with the power of the Black Wings,
<2618> \ There will be an opening before the counteracted power can be activated.
<2619> \{[Rei]}
<2620> "Andーwhile those wings are not manifested,
<2621> \ Physical attacks are also effective.
<2622> \{[Rei]}
<2623> "If we attack the main body during that time, perhaps..."
<2624> \{[Rei]}
<2625> "He needs me, but I can't kill him.
<2626> \ That's where we can take advantage of the opportunity.
<2627> \{[Rei]}
<2628> "They're not an opponent we can't beat. We have a chance of winning.
<2629> \ ...I won't give up."
<2630> \{[Nozomi]}
<2631> "...Yes!"
<2632> I told him to be reassuring,
<2633> Nozomi seems to have relaxed, as she relaxes her expression and smiles.
<2634> However, there is something I haven't told Nozomi.
<2635> \{[Rei]}
<2636> (...Just being slightly hurt by a normal attack,
<2637> \ He heals his wounds quickly.)
<2638> \{[Rei]}
<2639> (It seems like that incredible recovery ability is nullified.
<2640> \ Such an attack is necessary...)
<2641> \{[Rei]}
<2642> (To defeat him, we still need the power of the Angels.
<2643> \ The power of a true angel, as handed down by Takahisa Kujo)
<2644> The power of the Black Wings wielded by the young man,
<2645> I was able to come into contact with advanced information about humans,
<2646> All I can do is untie it.
<2647> The power of the \<Angel\> that Marie showed,
<2648> It had reached the stage of rewriting the information of existence,
<2649> The targets on which the power could be exerted were limited.
<2650> \{[Rei]}
<2651> (To defeat that black-winged Angel,
<2652> \ Marie's power is not enough...)
<2653> \{[Rei]}
<2654> (The power of the Angels has reached a higher level,
<2655> \ I need it--)
<2656> A higher being called an "Angel" that is not of this world,
<2657> If we do not read deeply and understand the roots that form the soul,
<2658> The law of causality cannot be rewritten.
<2659> Touching the deeper parts of higher existence,
<2660> Grasp the root of it.
<2661> \{[Rei]}
<2662> (Can I do that?)
<2663> \{[Rei]}
<2664> (...I don't know.
<2665> \ But I have no choice.)
<2666> \{[Nozomi]}
<2667> "Um, Rei-san. What I can do is,
<2668> \ Don't you have any...?
<2669> \{[Rei]}
<2670> "No -- he's targeting me.
<2671> \ You'd better break up with me and run away on your own from now on."
<2672> \{[Rei]}
<2673> "While I'm distracting him, you leave the mansion.
<2674> \ I was the one who was in charge of the collar..."
<2675> \{[Nozomi]}
<2676> "...No. I won't run away alone.
<2677> \ I'll go with you."
<2678> \{[Rei]}
<2679> "Please listen to me, Nozomi.
<2680> \ You're in great danger when you're with me."
<2681> \{[Nozomi]}
<2682> "No matter how dangerous it is... I'll be with you, Rei."
<2683> \{[Nozomi]}
<2684> "I'm weak, but no matter how weak I am...
<2685> \ But even so, I want to do something for Rei-san...!"
<2686> \{[Nozomi]}
<2687> "Above all, I believe that Rei will definitely win.
<2688> \ So... I'm not scared."
<2689> \{[Nozomi]}
<2690> "Please, let me stay by your side."
<2691> \{[Rei]}
<2692> “Nozomi…”
<2693> \{[Rei]}
<2694> "...Okay. Let's stay together."
<2695> \{[Rei]}
<2696> "Even if we part ways here, there's no guarantee that we'll be safe.
<2697> \ It might be better to stay close and protect him."
<2698> \{[Nozomi]}
<2699> "Thank you so much...!"
<2700> \{[Rei]}
<2701> "Then... there's something I'd like to ask for your help with.
<2702> \ Can I ask you for a favor?
<2703> \{[Hope]}
<2704> "Yes! Anything I can do!"
<2705> I took Nozomi to the other side of the mansion and went down the stairs.
<2706> Rei reached the entrance hall once again.
<2707> There is no one in the hall, and only the smell of gunpowder remains.
<2708> In that empty hall,
<2709> Rei and Nozomi waited for the arrival of the black-winged Angel.
<2710> Shortly afterwards, a young man also appears in the hall.
<2711> \{[Nue]}
<2712> "You didn't run away because you gave up on struggling in vain?
<2713> \ Or are you up to something..."
<2714> \{[Nue]}
<2715> "...Huh? There's no sign of the other Angel.
<2716> \ Did she run away?
<2717> \{[Rei]}
<2718> "I have inherited all of Marie's powers.
<2719> \ From here on, I'll fight you."
<2720> \{[Nue]}
<2721> "--I see. In other words, you have the same Angelic power as her,
<2722> \ So you got it?
<2723> \{[Nue]}
<2724> "But you haven't awakened your true power.
<2725> \ With that level of strength, you can't defeat me, you know?
<2726> \{[Rei]}
<2727> "--I wonder about that.
<2728> \ You won't know the results unless you try."
<2729> \{[Nue]}
<2730> "...Then let me teach you a lesson.
<2731> \ The difference in strength between you and me is clearly visible on your body.
<2732> \{[Nue]}
<2733> "With the power of the Black Wings...!"
<2734> The young man's black wings spread wide across his back,
<2735> The battle begins.
<2736> The power that Rei unleashes and the power that the young man unleashes are in a dangerous antagonism,
<2737> The sounds of the two people's powers, which seem different yet overlap,
<2738> Interfere and create discord.
<2739> Creaking, crushing,
<2740> It cannot be heard by the human ear,
<2741> A sound emanating from the power of heresy.
<2742> Both sides were immobilized by the other's power.
<2743> And that was exactly what Rei had planned.
<2744> He grabbed the young man's arm,
<2745> Rei shouted, still holding him tightly to prevent him from escaping.
<2746> \{[Rei]}
<2747> "--Nozomi, now!"
<2748> \{[Nozomi]}
<2749> "Yes...!"
<2750> As we discussed earlier,
<2751> To destroy the console panel on the wall of the hall,
<2752> Nozomi raises the iron candlestick she is holding.
<2753> \{[Nue]}
<2754> "--I don't know what you're planning to do, but I won't let you get in my way!"
<2755> With a cold declaration,
<2756> The young man's free arm sharply hurled a slender knife at him.
<2757> A flash of light cuts through the darkness...
<2758> And then, on the defenseless back of Nozomi,
<2759> Sink deep.
<2760> \{[Nozomi]}
<2761> "...Ah..."
<2762> With a voice that seemed to be coming from the heart,
<2763> Her weak, delicate body slowly collapses to the floor.
<2764> \{[Rei]}
<2765> "Nozomi..."
<2766> A small body collapsed on the floor.
<2767> His pale lips trembled as he muttered something,
<2768> The sound is so faint that it doesn't reach me.
<2769> He leaned his head on the floor and gazed at Rei.
<2770> The brilliance of life fades away before your eyes.
<2771> It's like the whole world is falling apart from your feet.
<2772> An unbearable fear attacks Rei.
<2773> \{[Rei]}
<2774> “Nozomi……!!”
<2775> The feeling of running on the floor is somewhat unreliable,
<2776> The world is made of such fragile materials,
<2777> Rei realized this for the first time.
<2778> I picked up Nozomi's body, which was lying on the ground like a broken doll,
<2779> A small voice whispered in my ear.
<2780> \{[Nozomi]}
<2781> "I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help..."
<2782> \{[Rei]}
<2783> "There's no need for you to apologize.
<2784> \ It's all my fault for putting you in danger."
<2785> \{[Nozomi]}
<2786> "...I was the one who insisted you not run away alone.
<2787> \ Rei-san... it's not your fault..."
<2788> \{[Rei]}
<2789> “Nozomi…”
<2790> \{[Nozomi]}
<2791> "...Rei-san"
<2792> \{[Rei]}
<2793> "What's wrong? Are you in pain...?"
<2794> \{[Hope]}
<2795> "I sense the power of an angel within you..."
<2796> \{[Nozomi]}
<2797> "It's a very strong and beautiful force, and it wants to come out..."
<2798> \{[Nozomi]}
<2799> "I'm sure you can do it."
<2800> \{[Nozomi]}
<2801> "I can see it..."
<2802> \{[Rei]}
<2803> "......"
<2804> \{[Nozomi]}
<2805> "I promise I'll always be by your side..."
<2806> \{[hope]}
<2807> "I couldn't protect you... I'm sorry..."
<2808> \{[Rei]}
<2809> "......!"
<2810> \{[Nozomi]}
<2811> "Rei...san"
<2812> \{[Nozomi]}
<2813> "I'm... sorry..."
<2814> \{[Rei]}
<2815> “Nozomi…!?”
<2816> In your arms,
<2817> The feeling of a small life being lost so fleetingly,
<2818> Rei's heart screams.
<2819> \{[Rei]}
<2820> "Ugh...!"
<2821> Don't let go of Nozomi's life, which is about to depart far away.
<2822> Rei bites her lip and holds Nozomi tightly.
<2823> Someoneーsomething.
<2824> Please,
<2825> I want you to save Nozomi's life!
<2826> So strong that it makes me dizzy,
<2827> Rei prayed - and then...
<2828> \{[Mari]}
<2829> "...Rei-sama..."
<2830> Marie's gentle voice remains in Rei's memory.
<2831> It resonated vividly deep in my heart.
<2832> \{[Mari]}
<2833> "...The power of the Angel is within you..."
<2834> \{[Mari]}
<2835> "Please... don't forget that."
<2836> ...Yes. The power of the Angels is,
<2837> All of this is still firmly within Rei.
<2838> \{[Rei]}
<2839> (Ahh - that's right...)
<2840> \{[Rei]}
<2841> (...I remember now...)
<2842> For a long time, it has been as natural as breathing.
<2843> Rei was endowed with the power of an angel.
<2844> And fish don't need to be taught to swim,
<2845> So that you can swim naturally underwater,
<2846> Rei had no hesitation in using her Angel powers.
<2847> Knowing that you have power within you,
<2848> Know what that power can do.
<2849> At that time, Rei instinctively understood the power of the Angels,
<2850> I was aware of that--
<2851> After that, the power that Rei temporarily lost was
<2852> As Marie had said, he is now inside Rei.
<2853> And by connecting with hope and heart,
<2854> The door that had been sealed inside Rei had already opened.
<2855> If you just remember that,
<2856> And then――
<2857> With the power of the Angel, Nozomi can be saved.
<2858> \{[Rei]}
<2859> "...Nozomi. I'll protect you..."
<2860> While embracing Nozomi,
<2861> Rei concentrates deeply - deeply.
<2862> \{[Rei]}
<2863> (--I can see it. The light that keeps Nozomi alive...)
<2864> Touching the deepest part of the existence of hope,
<2865> Pour the light of the Angel within Rei into it,
<2866> Tune as you wish.
<2867> And so――
<2868> The information that governs existence is rewritten,
<2869> Rei healed the wounds that Nozomi had sustained, without a trace remaining.
<2870> \{[Rei]}
<2871> "Nozomi...open your eyes."
<2872> I called out to him and gently shook him.
<2873> Nozomi's eyelids trembled and she slowly opened her eyes.
<2874> \{[Nozomi]}
<2875> "Rei-san...?"
<2876> \{[Rei]}
<2877> "Are you okay, Nozomi?"
<2878> \{[Nozomi]}
<2879> "...Huh? What on earth happened to me...?"
<2880> \{[Rei]}
<2881> "...I think I've healed all my wounds,
<2882> \ If you notice anything strange, please tell me."
<2883> \{[Nozomi]}
<2884> "Rei-san... you... want me...?"
<2885> \{[Nue]}
<2886> "--That power!"
<2887> \{[Nue]}
<2888> "Not only do we unravel existence,
<2889> \ The power of a true angel, tuned to your will,
<2890> \ You've woken me up...!
<2891> \{[Nue]}
<2892> "I need that power...!"
<2893> \{[Nue]}
<2894> "Rei, I'll ask you one more time,
<2895> \ Would you like to come to me quietly?
<2896> \{[Rei]}
<2897> "...I have no intention of following you."
<2898> \{[Nue]}
<2899> "So, this time,
<2900> \ Let's put an end to that child's life...!"
<2901> \{[Rei]}
<2902> "Nozomiーget away!"
<2903> I pushed Nozomi's body backwards and let her escape.
<2904> Rei avoids the young man's attack.
<2905> The knife was released from the young man's hand again.
<2906> He attacked Nozomi, aiming for her forehead, but--
<2907> Just in time, he managed to get rid of the murder weapon.
<2908> The barrel of the pistol he was holding tightly fell off,
<2909> Hope was protected.
<2910> \{[Takami]}
<2911> "Hey, are you okay?!"
<2912> \{[Nozomi]}
<2913> "You...!"
<2914> \{[Rei]}
<2915> "...Takami! Are you safe...?"
<2916> \{[Takami]}
<2917> "Yeah, at least for now."
<2918> \{[Rei]}
<2919> "Just leave it at that, Nozomi...!"
<2920> \{[Takami]}
<2921> "Huh? Hey, Rei...!"
<2922> There is no time to respond to Takami's words.
<2923> Rei touched the floor, just like Marie had done,
<2924> If you rewrite the information of existence,
<2925> A spear is launched from the floor, aimed at the young man's feet.
<2926> The young man jumped back to avoid it,
<2927> As I put my foot down, I found a trap that Rei had set.
<2928> \{[Nue]}
<2929> "Ugh...!"
<2930> The appearance remains the same,
<2931> The flooring has been remodeled to be thinner,
<2932> The young man steps through it with his foot and loses his balance.
<2933> That location was the one Rei had been aiming for all along.
<2934> If you leave it like this, it will be moved immediately.
<2935> I know it will be prevented,
<2936> Rei charges into the young man's body.
<2937> As expected, the physical attack was easily parried,
<2938> When Rei came to her senses, she found herself on the floor.
<2939> \{[Nue]}
<2940> "Rei, you're not used to fighting.
<2941> \ You can't beat me."
<2942> Nozomi, who was holding her breath and watching the situation unfold,
<2943> Realizing Rei's intention in inviting the young man to that place,
<2944> Pleading towards Takami.
<2945> \{[Hope]}
<2946> "...Takami-san! Please,
<2947> \ Please, drop that!
<2948> Takami's eyes widen in surprise as he looks in the direction Nozomi is pointing.
<2949> \{[Takami]}
<2950> "That? Why did youー"
<2951> \{[Nozomi]}
<2952> "Please, to help Rei,
<2953> \ Please...!
<2954> \{[Takami]}
<2955> "...Got it!"
<2956> \{[Takami]}
<2957> "Hey! You! Let go of Rei!"
<2958> Takami held the gun firmly in both hands,
<2959> I aimed and fired.
<2960> A gunshot rang out, and the bullet touched the young man's Black Wings,
<2961> A moment later it is dissolved from existence and disappears.
<2962> \{[Nue]}
<2963> "...It's you. If you had just quietly run away,
<2964> \ I let you off the hook."
<2965> \{[Nue]}
<2966> "Foolish head of the family - if you get in my way,
<2967> \ I'll erase you too."
<2968> \{[Takami]}
<2969> "...I'd rather not."
<2970> The gun was aimed at the young man.
<2971> Takami suddenly turns away and points it straight up at the ceiling.
<2972> \{[Nue]}
<2973> "What are you trying to do--?"
<2974> \{[Takami]}
<2975> "I'm going to defeat you...!"
<2976> Takami pulled the trigger several times, aiming at the ceiling.
<2977> The bullet fired from Takami's pistol,
<2978> Without missing a beat, a chandelier hangs from the ceiling,
<2979> The console panel has been successfully shot through.
<2980> \{[Nozomi]}
<2981> "Now, Rei-san--!"
<2982> A few moments after the panel sparked and shorted out,
<2983> The chandelier, its lock broken, crashed.
<2984> Shaking violently.
<2985> And thenーthe chandelier fell.
<2986> Straight onto the young manー
<2987> \{[Nue]}
<2988> "...!"
<2989> Losing its support, it poured down on my head,
<2990> A huge antique chandelier that gained momentum as it fell
<2991> The young man spreads his black wings and receives it.
<2992> \{[Nue]}
<2993> "......"
<2994> A direct hit would be fatal,
<2995> Absorb all the power of the Black Wings and place them stationary above your head.
<2996> \{[Nue]}
<2997> "Ugh!"
<2998> And thenーhe,
<2999> The captured being is unwound into light using the power of the Black Wings.
<3000> As the shape of the chandelier unravels in the light,
<3001> The black wings spread across the young man's back,
<3002> It loses its color little by little, and its existence wavers like an illusion.
<3003> An object with that much mass that fell from the ceiling,
<3004> Catch it in the air and unravel it--
<3005> The act of processing a large amount of information in just a moment is
<3006> As expected, it seems to have caused quite a load.
<3007> Exceeding the capacity of information processing at the time,
<3008> The Black Wings have lost the power to maintain their physical presence in reality.
<3009> I am about to disappear from this place temporarily.
<3010> By the time the young man was able to deploy his Black Wings again,
<3011> A short time is needed to gather strength.
<3012> And for just that brief moment,
<3013> This Angel loses all means of defense and attack.
<3014> A momentary blank is fine.
<3015> If we can take advantage of that small gap that has appeared――!
<3016> Rei touched the floor with her injured right hand,
<3017> Summoning his willpower, he rewrites the information about that being.
<3018> Following Rei's will, a part of the bed transformed,
<3019> It transformed into multiple spears and attacked the young man.
<3020> \{[Nue]}
<3021> "Guh...!"
<3022> Caught off guard, unable to flap his Black Wings,
<3023> The young man's limbs are pierced.
<3024> \{[Nue]}
<3025> "Ugh...!"
<3026> The pain of spears piercing the palms of my hands and feet from below.
<3027> Even the young man's face changes color and he groans.
<3028> Nevertheless, the young man's composure was not lost.
<3029> A sarcastic smile never leaves my cheek.
<3030> \{[Nue]}
<3031> "...You did it, Rei."
<3032> \{[Nue]}
<3033> "Butーthis alone,
<3034> \ You can't defeat me...!"
<3035> \{[Rei]}
<3036> "I know. That's whyーIー"
<3037> The young man, whose limbs had been shot through, stopped moving.
<3038> As I stood up, I stretched out my right arm,
<3039> Rei touched the young man's forehead with her fingertips and said.
<3040> \{[Rei]}
<3041> "I will touch the very essence of your existence...!"
<3042> \{[Nue]}
<3043> "What...?!"
<3044> Gazing into the young man's eyes, which were wide with astonishment,
<3045> Rei focuses her attention on the place where her hand is touching.
<3046> Yes, the higher beings known as Angels,
<3047> If we don't read deeply and understand it until we reach its roots,
<3048> The law of causality with the world cannot be broken.
<3049> Therefore...
<3050> Of this being,
<3051> Much deeper――
<3052> Who governs this existence,
<3053> Touching a fragment of light, his entire existence,
<3054> Grab it!
<3055> When you grasp the young man's heart in your fingers - the very source of existence,
<3056> For a moment, all time stopped.
<3057> And thenーit resonated.
<3058> I lived a short life, only to unravel it.
<3059> The solitary Angel rang outーthe sound of his heart.
<3060> "Nameless--"
<3061> “From the moment I was born,
<3062> \ Not a life blessed by the Mother--"
<3063> “From the beginning, the way of life was decided by humans,
<3064> \ Days of killing and stealing
<3065> "Continue to unravel human life as requested,
<3066> \ The question that keeps coming back to my mind
<3067> "What do I seek on this earth, what do I want to obtain?
<3068> \ Are you alive here――”
<3069> “Even in this life, which has its end and is filled with the smell of death,
<3070> \ Is there any meaning to this――”
<3071> "Someone--"
<3072> "Answer――"
<3073> Rei gently touched the small sound with her finger,
<3074> I gently scooped it up in my palm.
<3075> I can hear youーyour heart.
<3076> You are just like me.
<3077> You lived in darkness, unable to find anyone who could save your heart.
<3078> Another me.
<3079> But... I've already found it.
<3080> The beings that live together in this world.
<3081> That's why I can't go with you.
<3082> For the two of us to touch each other like this,
<3083> It was just a little too late.
<3084>Thus ends a long-lasting decision,
<3085> I will never forget meeting you, the angel that you are.
<3086> \{[Nue]}
<3087> "...Rei"
<3088> \{[Nue]}
<3089> "You will be the only angel in this world,
<3090> \ Aren't you lonely--?"
<3091> It's okay.
<3092> Because I got this sound here.
<3093> Rei is a memorable sound - a sound that resonates with Nozomi's heart,
<3094> The beautiful sound reached the young man's heart.
<3095> A strange tone echoes around.
<3096> The fragments of my heart tremble with the minute vibrations,
<3097> Slowly, the black, rough fragments are unraveled.
<3098> \{[Nue]}
<3099> "I see--"
<3100> The last shred of light that made up the young man,
<3101> The moment you disappear from this world.
<3102> Smiling calmly,
<3103> Expressing his quiet thoughts, a wave of light burst forth.
<3104> The Angel, whose causal relationship with the world has been broken,
<3105> Losing the power to remain in this dimension,
<3106> Cease to exist - return to light.
<3107> Everythingーdisappeared in the light.
<3108> Epilogue
<3109> There, far awayーfar awayーat the end of the horizon,
<3110> Beyond the events of this world.
<3111> A place that can definitely be seen, but can never be touched.
<3112> No man can even see it,
<3113> In such an unreachable place,
<3114> There was that which the children of men call \ruby{〈Angel〉}={Rachiel}.
<3115> One look and you can tell it's not human.
<3116> Because on its back - emitting white light and occupying space,
<3117> Because it has a pair of large "wings."
<3118> A faint, enigmatic smile was printed on her elegant lips.
<3119> He turned his fair-skinned face towards the void,
<3120> Deep within her closed eyes, the Angel dreams.
<3121> Filled with the light of the small and fleeting lives of the children of men,
<3122> The world is like a miniature garden.
<3123> Among the children of men, those who possess the radiance of angels,
<3124> There, we can see them together, alive.
<3125> Born on earth as a reflection of the Angel,
<3126> A lonely young man.
<3127> Through the eyes of that young man,
<3128> The souls of the Angels have lived together on earth,
<3129> Even the young man who is his reflection doesn't know.
<3130> Like a single doll placed in a miniature garden,
<3131> The young man, Rei, was a lonely creature.
<3132> Living alone, repeating meetings and partings,
<3133> I watched until I found people with whom I could share a heart.
<3134> I watched over you - or rather, it was something deeper.
<3135> Resonating with the movements of Rei's heart, resonating with the same tone,
<3136> A life as a human being,
<3137> It can be said that the Angel also walked with Rei.
<3138> Through Rei's gaze,
<3139> To live and feel in the same world as the children of menー
<3140> Through the heart of Rei, I know the suffering and troubles of the children of men,
<3141> And to feel joy--
<3142> All of these things,
<3143> The Angel lives with his reflection, Rei,
<3144> Even though I wasn't supposed to be on earth, I definitely "felt" it.
<3145> "...Comfortable."
<3146> Rei, the angel born on earth, plays this song.
<3147> Beautifully sparkling and radiant,
<3148> Listen to the satisfying, pleasant sound.
<3149> And so, wrapped in a happy dream,
<3150> The Angel goes to sleep.
<3151> The sound of wings of the imprisoned Angel, slumbering in a dream,
<3152> One of the sons of man who has received it in his heart,
<3153> A \ruby{dream}={simulation} of rebirth depicted in the miniature world of Earth――
<3154> Now, that dream has quietly come to an end.
