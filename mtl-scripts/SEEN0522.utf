<0000> \{[Rei]}
<0001> "Yeah, that's not bad either.
<0002> \ Then I'll ask you to show me around.
<0003> \ Oh... don't forget the basket."
<0004> \{[Takami]}
<0005> "...So I have to carry it after all?"
<0006> The green color is much deeper than when the new leaves were growing.
<0007> An early summer morning, coloring various parts of the forest.
<0008> Rei was guided by Takami,
<0009> I was strolling through the forest, stepping firmly on the soft undergrowth.
<0010> Occasionally, I squint my eyes at the dazzling sunlight filtering through the leaves,
<0011> Only in forests lined with old trees,
<0012> When you take a deep breath of the unique forest air,
<0013> I feel like my body and mind, tired from the hustle and bustle of the city, are lightened.
<0014> \{[Takami]}
<0015> "Hey, Rei... don't you feel a little empty?
<0016> \ Two guys walking through the forest with a basket in hand, huh?
<0017> \{[Rei]}
<0018> "--A little."
<0019> \{[Takami]}
<0020> "You know... you're harassing me with your body like that,
<0021> \ There's no need to go to the trouble..."
<0022> \{[Rei]}
<0023> "It's fine. Whatever the faces,
<0024> \ It's nice to walk through the forest at this time of day.
<0025> \ I'm having a lot more fun than I thought I would.
<0026> \{[Takami]}
<0027> "Well... that's true.
<0028> \ Walking through the forest like this early in the morning,
<0029> \ I wonder how many years it's been..."
<0030> As I continued walking slowly through the forest,
<0031> As if blocking my way,
<0032> A towering cliff with its moss-covered rock surface appeared.
<0033> The forest ends just below the cliff.
<0034> The area that had opened up a little had become a natural plaza.
<0035> I followed the towering rock face and looked up,
<0036> I can see a blue sky that looks like it was cut out.
<0037> Takami stopped dead in the middle of the grass.
<0038> He turned to Rei and said.
<0039> \{[Takami]}
<0040> "Hey, Rei. Do you remember this place?"
<0041> \{[Rei]}
<0042> "...No. This is my first time around here.
<0043> \ I don't remember.
<0044> \{[Takami]}
<0045> "......"
<0046> He became annoyed at Rei's words and remained silent.
<0047> Takami quickly turned his back on the place.
<0048> He begins walking away with rough steps, his anger clearly evident.
<0049> As I followed Takami's back as he left with his shoulders hunched in anger,
<0050> Rei frowned at the outburst of anger, the cause of which was unclear.
<0051> \{[Rei]}
<0052> "--Takami. What have you been angry about all this time?"
<0053> \{[Takami]}
<0054> "…………Nothing. Nothing!"
<0055> \{[Rei]}
<0056> "You're showing me such a sulky attitude,
<0057> \ There's no such thing as "nothing," right?"
<0058> \{[Rei]}
<0059> "What's wrong? I can't believe I made you carry the basket.
<0060> \ Are you still angry?
<0061> \{[Takami]}
<0062> "No, that has nothing to do with it!"
<0063> \{[Takami]}
<0064> "...There's another reason why I'm in a bad mood.
<0065> \ However, there's no point in telling you about it,
<0066> \ I don't want to talk about anything right now."
<0067> \{[Takami]}
<0068> "Sorry. Forget it."
<0069> \{[Rei]}
<0070> "--Is that so? Then I won't ask."
<0071> \{[Rei]}
<0072> "By the way, regarding the matter of having them carry baskets,
<0073> \ Are you really not angry?
<0074> \{[Takami]}
<0075> "Oh, well... it's a little embarrassing,
<0076> \ This doesn't make me grumpy.
<0077> \ And I like the sweets inside..."
<0078> \{[Rei]}
<0079> "...This cake?"
<0080> \{[Takami]}
<0081> "These sweets that Marie forced you to have,
<0082> \ It's actually my favorite food."
<0083> \{[Takami]}
<0084> "When Marie brought out this candy before,
<0085> \ He remembered what I said."
<0086> \{[Rei]}
<0087> "Wow, you're having that kind of conversation with Marie,
<0088> \ Were you close to her?
<0089> \ Has Marie been working for you for a long time?
<0090> \{[Takami]}
<0091> "No. Marie was hired a year ago to fill a vacancy.
<0092> \ This is a new hire I made.
<0093> I started working at the mansion about four months ago... I think."
<0094> \{[Takami]}
<0095> "Before I appointed you and Nozomi as my personal maid,
<0096> \ Marie worked as my maid for a while.
<0097> \{[Takami]}
<0098> "Despite appearances, Marie is a pretty good maid.
<0099> \ In the short time he served me,
<0100> \ He knew exactly how to season it to my liking."
<0101> \{[Takami]}
<0102> "Well, as you know,
<0103> \ The only downside is that he's a bit careless..."
<0104> \{[Rei]}
<0105> "...That's surprising. You think of Marie,
<0106> \ You think very highly of it."
<0107> \{[Takami]}
<0108> "He's a rare and precious type of person these days."
<0109> \{[Takami]}
<0110> "It seems like you're studying a lot of things without thinking about the pros and cons,
<0111> \ When I asked him why,
<0112> "I like to see the other person's happy face," he replied.
<0113> \{[Takami]}
<0114> "I made Marie your personal maid because
<0115> \ Although it was his own wish,
<0116> \ That's why I felt I could trust him..."
<0117> \{[Takami]}
<0118> "She has the proper consideration of a maid,
<0119> \ Because I was a hardworking person,
<0120> \ I felt like I could entrust him with a role that required meticulous attention to detail."
<0121> \{[Rei]}
<0122> "......"
<0123> \{[Takami]}
<0124> "...What is it? Staring at people's faces.
<0125> \ Is there something you want to say?
<0126> \{[Rei]}
<0127> "...Once again, it was unexpected,
<0128> \ You care about me and Nozomi much more than I thought.
<0129> \ It seems like you were genuinely concerned about me."
<0130> \{[Takami]}
<0131> "--! It's not like that...!"
<0132> \{[Rei]}
<0133> “There’s no need to be embarrassed. That’s a good attitude.
<0134> I'm honestly happy about your feelings."
<0135> \{[Takami]}
<0136> "...Uh..."
<0137> \{[Takami]}
<0138> "...Well, whatever! Anyway,
<0139> \ I quite like Marie,
<0140> \ By the way, what about you?
<0141> \{[Takami]}
<0142> "What do you think of Marie as a maid?"
<0143> I like it too
<0144> I don't think anything in particular.
<0145> ◇I like it too
<0146> \{[Rei]}
<0147> "I like you too, Marie."
<0148> \{[Takami]}
<0149> "I see, that's good then."
<0150> \{[Rei]}
<0151> "I think she's a caring girl,
<0152> \ I don't think anything in particular..."
<0153> \{[Takami]}
<0154> "I see..."
<0155> After walking for a while,
<0156> We arrived near a small lake hidden in the shade of the trees.
<0157> \{[Takami]}
<0158> "It's a small lake that doesn't appear on large-scale maps,
<0159> \ Only locals know,
<0160> \ What do you think? The view is quite nice, isn't it?
<0161> He seems a little proud, even though it's not his own fault.
<0162> Takami seemed to be acting strangely.
<0163> Rei couldn't help but smile as she nodded.
<0164> Just like the forest, it was a quiet place with no people around.
<0165> What you can hear even if you strain your ears
<0166> The only sounds were the birds and the rustling of trees in the wind.
<0167> \{[Rei]}
<0168> "...The view is nice, so let's take a rest here,
<0169> \ Shall we have tea and some Marie cake?"
<0170> Takami nodded in response to Rei's invitation.
<0171> I sat down on the soft grass,
<0172> He silently munches on the sweets he has taken out of the basket.
<0173> I just can't seem to calm down.
<0174> I felt somehow comfortable, with mixed emotions.
<0175> The two of them looked out at the lake for a while.
<0176> It's been like that for a long time,
<0177> I was sitting by the lake, feeling the cool breeze blowing across the water,
<0178> I can't stay in this place forever.
<0179> Rei stretched out her legs,
<0180> I tried to shake off the reluctant desire to stay seated.
<0181> I took a leap of faith and raised my hips.
<0182> \{[Rei]}
<0183> "The sun is getting pretty high in the sky.
<0184> \ Shall we go home now?
<0185> \{[Takami]}
<0186> "That's right. I guess we should pull up."
<0187> Was Takami feeling the same way as Rei?
<0188> The tone of his voice and his facial expression,
<0189> He was filled with a feeling of utter regret,
<0190> Takami stands up as if giving up.
<0191> \{[Takami]}
<0192> "From here, it would be quicker to head straight for the mansion.
<0193> \ You probably won't know the way,
<0194> \ I'll take you straight to the mansion."
<0195> \{[Rei]}
<0196> "That would be appreciated. Please guide me."
<0197> Saying goodbye to the lake view,
<0198> With Takami as their guide, the two of them walk through the forest towards the mansion.
<0199> On the way back, Takami and I exchanged few words,
<0200> That alone was enough to give Rei a sense of satisfaction.
<0201> I find that very strange,
<0202> It happened on a refreshing early summer day.
