<0000> May 1st
<0001> It's like being gently pushed forward.
<0002> I felt as if I was being called by a soft whisper in my earlobe,
<0003> I walk alone through the blue darkness.
<0004> The lights of the people's festive feast are far away from here,
<0005> Only the soft moonlight
<0006> A faint light illuminating the ground in the dim darkness.
<0007> I walked through a long, dark corridor with the lights off and up a flight of stairs.
<0008> Not knowing where it will lead,
<0009> But with every step,
<0010> My confidence is only growing that I am getting closer to my goal.
<0011> Where are you heading?
<0012> What are you looking for?
<0013> I can't remember the reason or what prompted me to start going there,
<0014>But even so, my feet kept moving forward without any hesitation.
<0015> I don't feel lonely.
<0016> The anxiety of walking alone aimlessly through the dark night
<0017> There is no fear of the darkness that swallows up even the smallest footsteps.
<0018> Secret loneliness is his long-time friend.
<0019> A faint echo in the distance,
<0020> Pulling at the thread-like presence...
<0021> Stepping on the carpet of the unfamiliar mansion,
<0022> You won't get lost in the intricate, maze-like garden...
<0023> Like a wanderer seeking a place of rest,
<0024> He continues walking.
<0025> --Who...?
<0026> --You've been calling me this whole time,
<0027> --Who are you...?
<0028> But soon.
<0029> The dim landscape that enveloped him was
<0030> The ink dropped on the kaishi paper blurs like a blur.
<0031> It slowly begins to lose its shape.
<0032> Soon it will encompass everything and expand,
<0033> Darkness and silence.
<0034> --You...
<0035> --Who...
<0036> --Who is this...?
<0037> I can't see anything anymore.
<0038> I can't hear anything.
<0039> No sign of anyone calling out reaches me here.
<0040> And then silence.
<0041> --Silence.
<0042> The dazzling sunlight,
<0043> The refreshing morning view of the unfamiliar ceiling painted white,
<0044> I was dreaming until just now,
<0045> Rei finally realized.
<0046> \{[? ? ]}
<0047> "Have you woken up, Rei-sama...?"
<0048> Before I could even wake up from the lingering dream that was making my heart race,
<0049> The girl's words had a soft, pleasant tone,
<0050> It is gently delivered to Rei's ears as she wakes up.
<0051> Enticed by the modest voice, I slowly turned my sights,
<0052> Standing by the window, gazing at me,
<0053> Dressed in a unique costume that indicates servant status,
<0054> The figure of a young girl catches my eye.
<0055> \{[? ? ]}
<0056> "Good morning, Rei-sama!
<0057> \ Look, the sky is so blue.
<0058> \ It looks like it's going to be good weather today.
<0059> Kindly and cheerfully,
<0060> The girl called out Rei's name and smiled at him.
<0061> I don't remember.
<0062> \{［伶］}
<0063> "...Who are you?"
<0064> \{[Mari]}
<0065> "Oh, sorry for the late greeting!
<0066> \ Nice to meet you, I'm \ruby{Miyashiro}={Miyashiro}\ruby{Mari}={Marie}.
<0067> \ I'm Rei-sama's personal maid and noodle maker."
<0068> \{[Mari]}
<0069> "I was told to take care of Rei-sama,
<0070> \ That's what I'm saying.
<0071> \ Please let me know if you need anything.
<0072> \{［伶］}
<0073> "My personal maid... you'll take care of me."
<0074> \{[Mari]}
<0075> "Yes, I will serve Lady Rei!
<0076> \ I hope that Rei-sama will have a comfortable stay in this mansion.
<0077> \ I will do my best.
<0078> \{[Mari]}
<0079> "I'm still inexperienced,
<0080> \ There may be times when it falls short,
<0081> \ Please help me out."
<0082> \{[Mari]}
<0083> "...Welcome to the mansion, Rei-sama.
<0084> \ We have been waiting for your visit, Rei-sama.
<0085> \ We warmly welcome you.
<0086> \{［伶］}
<0087> "Mari..."
<0088> \{[Mari]}
<0089> "Yes, Rei-sama, what is it?"
<0090> \{［伶］}
<0091> "The jacket you've been stepping on under your shoes for a while now,
<0092> \ Could you please get it for me?
<0093> \{[Mari]}
<0094> "Oh, I'm so sorry...!"
<0095> Last night, I was too lazy to tidy up properly,
<0096> The jacket hanging over the back of the chair,
<0097> Perhaps it was the breeze that blew in through the window that caused it to flinch.
<0098> It falls to the floor.
<0099> Perhaps you were so excited that you didn't see it.
<0100> Marie had stepped on it without realizing it.
<0101> In response to Rei's quiet words of criticism,
<0102> He appears panicked and jumps away.
<0103> \{［伶］}
<0104> "Oh, if you hurry like that you'll fall."
<0105> \{[Mari]}
<0106> "Hyaaaahhh?!"
<0107> ...As soon as I said that,
<0108> Marie takes a spectacular fall.
<0109> The advice was meaningless.
<0110> Feeling a slight weakness, Rei let out a sigh.
<0111> \{[Mari]}
<0112> "Ouch, that hurts..."
<0113> Marie fell to the floor with all her might,
<0114> Did you hit it hard?
<0115> Her eyes were watering and she was constantly rubbing her lower back.
<0116> Lend a hand
<0117> Do nothing
<0118> I was under no obligation to help,
<0119> I can't bear to abandon them like this.
<0120> Rei got up from the bed,
<0121> He offers his hand to Marie to help her stand up.
<0122> \{［伶］}
<0123> "That was quite a spectacular fall. Are you okay?"
<0124> \{[Mari]}
<0125> "Th...Thank you!"
<0126> \{［伶］}
<0127> "You shouldn't rush to get up. You'll fall again.
<0128> \ Come on, give me your hand."
<0129> \{[Mari]}
<0130> "I'm sorry..."
<0131> With a nervous look on his face, he took Rei's hand,
<0132> Marie raised her hips in a jerky, awkward motion.
<0133> Finally, I stood up,
<0134> He quickly lets go of Rei's hand and shrinks back apologetically.
<0135> To the person who fell down on their own in a panic,
<0136> There is no obligation to help.
<0137> Rei watched in silence as Marie fell on her bottom.
<0138> Marie must be in a lot of pain where she was hit,
<0139> He kept rubbing his lower back,
<0140> Although staggering, he somehow manages to stand up on his own.
<0141> \{[Mari]}
<0142> "Sorry. I've shown you my shameful side.
<0143> \ I'm embarrassed..."
<0144> \{[Mari]}
<0145> "...When I first greeted you,
<0146> \ I want to be a reliable person who can help you.
<0147> \ I wanted to give you a good show."
<0148> \{[Mari]}
<0149> "And yet..."
<0150> \{［伶］}
<0151> "--That's unfortunate.
<0152> \ If anything,
<0153> \ You've suddenly shown me something that makes me uneasy."
<0154> \{[Mari]}
<0155> "It wasn't supposed to be like this..."
<0156> Like a puppy that has been caught mischievously and scolded,
<0157> Seeing Marie with her head down in dejection,
<0158> An indescribable sense of humor welled up in Rei's heart.
<0159> \{［伶］}
<0160> "Show me you can be relied upon---"
<0161> Rei burst out laughing, her shoulders shaking.
<0162> Marie blushed even more as she became embarrassed.
<0163> She pleaded desperately, her voice sounding like she was on the verge of tears.
<0164> \{[Mari]}
<0165> "I know I'm inexperienced.
<0166> \ But even so, I, Rei-sama, want to satisfy you,
<0167> \ I intend to serve you even at the cost of my own life!
<0168> \{[Mari]}
<0169> "So please,
<0170> \ Please let me be of use to you, Rei-sama..."
<0171> \{［伶］}
<0172> "You only take care of my personal needs,
<0173> \ Your words are quite exaggerated.
<0174> \ I would serve you even if it meant giving my life for you."
<0175> \{[Mari]}
<0176> "Huh? Is that so?"
<0177> \{[Mari]}
<0178> "But I'm that serious.
<0179> \ Now that I've been given the role of a dedicated maid,
<0180> \ I hope you will be satisfied, Rei-sama."
<0181> \{[Mari]}
<0182> "The words 'even at the cost of my life'
<0183> \ For me,
<0184> \ I don't mean to make such a big deal out of it..."
<0185> Her gaze was so earnest and pleading,
<0186> It doesn't seem to involve any lies or acting.
<0187> Seeing Marie trying so hard, Rei finally stops laughing.
<0188> \{［伶］}
<0189> "Sorry for laughing.
<0190> \ I'm sure you know more about the mansion than I do,
<0191> \ If anything happens, I'll rely on you."
<0192> \{［伶］}
<0193> "Once again, I look forward to working with you. Marie."
<0194> \{[Mari]}
<0195> "Yes, thank you very much, Rei-sama!"
<0196> \{[Mari]}
<0197> "To make Rei-sama's stay comfortable,
<0198> \ Taking care of them,
<0199> \ It's my job as your personal maid."
<0200> \{[Mari]}
<0201> "If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know.
<0202> \ In order to please Lady Rei,
<0203> \ I will do my best to help you."
<0204> \{[Mari]}
<0205> "Is there anything you would like to request?
<0206> \ For now, the meal is ready,
<0207> \ If you'd like, I can show you to the dining room."
<0208> \{［伶］}
<0209> "That's right. I have a favor to ask you right away."
<0210> \{[Mari]}
<0211> "Yes, what is it?"
<0212> \{［伶］}
<0213> "Could you please pick up my jacket?
<0214> \ It would be bad to go out in public in this outfit."
<0215> \{[Mari]}
<0216> "Oh! Sorry, that was inconsiderate!"
<0217> \{［伶］}
<0218> "Also, if possible, I'd like you to wait outside.
<0219> \ I'm not used to changing clothes while being watched.
<0220> \ Oh, or do you want to see me get changed?
<0221> \{[Mari]}
<0222> "I'll wait for you outside...!"
<0223> He picked up the jacket and handed it to me as if tossing it away.
<0224> Marie panicked and ran out of the room.
<0225> Rei couldn't help but laugh out loud.
<0226> \{[Mari]}
<0227> "We have a seat for you here.
<0228> \ Please have a seat.
<0229> Encouraged by a cheerful smile,
<0230> When Rei sat down at the table where breakfast was set,
<0231> Marie picked up a steaming silver pot from a cart.
<0232> Transfer the golden consomme soup to a plate.
<0233> \{[Mari]}
<0234> "We haven't asked you about your food preferences,
<0235> \ For now, this morning,
<0236> \ We have prepared a menu for you here.
<0237> \{[Mari]}
<0238> "If you have any requests, please let us know.
<0239> \ We can prepare anything, Japanese, Western, Italian, etc.!
<0240> \ What would you like for lunch or dinner?
<0241> \{［伶］}
<0242> "I don't really care whatsoever.
<0243> I don't have much attachment to food. A small amount is fine.
<0244> \{[Mari]}
<0245> "...Rei-sama, if you only eat a small amount of food,
<0246> \ I heard about it from Takami-sama.
<0247> \ Are there many ingredients and seasonings that you can't eat?
<0248> \{［伶］}
<0249> "I've never liked artificial flavors.
<0250> \ My body can't tolerate chemical seasonings.
<0251> \ So I don't eat food that doesn't suit my taste.
<0252> \{[Mari]}
<0253> "I see... Then you'll eat less."
<0254> \{［伶］}
<0255> "I'm used to it, so it's not a problem."
<0256> \{[Mari]}
<0257> "So, during your stay at the mansion,
<0258> \ So that Rei-sama can enjoy her meal,
<0259> \ I'll prepare it with all my heart!
<0260> \{[Mari]}
<0261> "How's your breakfast this morning?
<0262> \ This bread was just baked this morning in the kitchen of the building.
<0263> \ Do you think it will suit your taste...?
<0264> Marie looked at me with such serious eyes,
<0265> Rei tears off a small piece of bread from the plate and takes a bite.
<0266> \{［伶］}
<0267> "Oh, this is delicious.
<0268> \ There doesn't seem to be any strange artifacts inside.
<0269> \ This will be fine."
<0270> \{[Mari]}
<0271> "Great! Then I'll bake bread again tomorrow!
<0272> \ Oh, do you like walnuts?
<0273> \{［伶］}
<0274> "...I don't dislike it."
<0275> \{[Mari]}
<0276> "Then, I'll prepare some walnut bread tomorrow.
<0277> \ Please enjoy it."
<0278> \{［伶］}
<0279> "Oh... By the way, Marie.
<0280> \ There's one thing I'd like to ask you--"
<0281> \{[Mari]}
<0282> "Yes, what is it?"
<0283> Did you bake the bread?
<0284> How is Nozomi doing?
<0285> Has there been any contact from Takami?
<0286> \{［伶］}
<0287> "Could it be that this bread was baked by...
<0288> \ Is that you?
<0289> \{[Mari]}
<0290> "Yes. We have a dedicated chef at the inn,
<0291> \ When you have free time,
<0292> \ I also help out in the kitchen."
<0293> \{[Mari]}
<0294> "Well, I guess I'm just an uninvited apprentice.
<0295> \ Recipes for dishes you don't know yet,
<0296> \ I'm currently learning from the chef.
<0297> \{[Mari]}
<0298> "My repertoire has expanded since I started working at this mansion.
<0299> \ Learning to cook is fun."
<0300> \{［伶］}
<0301> "...Just like before,
<0302> \ Do you ever fail at cooking?
<0303> \{[Mari]}
<0304> "It is impossible to turn over something that has been completed.
<0305> \ It happens often,
<0306> \ I have never had a cooking mistake."
<0307> \{［伶］}
<0308> "Right. That's reassuring.
<0309> \ As long as you stay in this mansion,
<0310> \ It looks like I won't have any trouble finding food."
<0311> \{[Mari]}
<0312> "Yes, leave the food to me!
<0313> \ I hope that Rei-sama will be happy, even if just a little.
<0314> \ I'll do my best!
<0315> \{[Mari]}
<0316> "Oh, today's breakfast too,
<0317> \ Please enjoy it before it gets cold.
<0318> \ Would you like some fresh milk?
<0319> \{［伶］}
<0320> "Yeah... I'll have it."
<0321> He gave an ambiguous reply to Marie's words,
<0322> Rei reluctantly picked up the spoon and placed it on her chest.
<0323> I suddenly wondered what Nozomi was up to at this time.
<0324> A question arises.
<0325> \{［伶］}
<0326> "...Mariie, how is Nozomi doing?
<0327> \ Although he is not here,
<0328> \ Doesn't she have breakfast?
<0329> \{[Mari]}
<0330> "No. Nozomi-san didn't really
<0331> \ I don't eat a lot of food,
<0332> \ He manages to eat every meal.
<0333> \{[Mari]}
<0334> "However, Takami-sama told Nozomi-san,
<0335> \ I would like to dine with the owner of the inn.
<0336> \ Please forbid it..."
<0337> \{[Mari]}
<0338> "So, by now, Nozomi-san,
<0339> \ Alone in your room,
<0340> \ They are having a meal."
<0341> \{［伶］}
<0342> "I see. Takami said something like that.
<0343> \ ...That's typical of him."
<0344> A child destined to be a commodity,
<0345> The idea of not allowing the wife to accompany the husband at meals is
<0346> It was very much like Takami.
<0347> \{[Mari]}
<0348> "Um... I know this is presumptuous, but
<0349> \ If you don't mind, Rei-sama,
<0350> \ Would you like to have a meal with Nozomi-san...?
<0351> \{［伶］}
<0352> "Me, having dinner with Nozomi?
<0353> \ --Why would you do something like that?"
<0354> \{[Mari]}
<0355> "When I leave Nozomi alone to eat,
<0356> \ He only takes a small bite.
<0357> I think Nozomi-san has trouble eating when he's alone.
<0358> \{[Mari]}
<0359> "If things continue like this,
<0360> \ I was worried that one day Nozomi would break down.
<0361> \ I'm very worried about that.
<0362> \{[Mari]}
<0363> "But if I could have dinner with you, Rei-sama,
<0364> \ The lonely dinner table became lively,
<0365> \ I think it might stimulate Nozomi's appetite..."
<0366> \{[Mari]}
<0367> "...I'm sorry."
<0368> \{［伶］}
<0369> "......"
<0370> \{[Mari]}
<0371> "Well..."
<0372> \{［伶］}
<0373> "...I understand. I won't make any promises, but I'll think about it.
<0374> \ Is that okay?
<0375> \{[Mari]}
<0376> "Yes, thank you very much!"
<0377> \{［伶］}
<0378> "By the way, Marie. This morning Takami told me,
<0379> \ Have you received any news?
<0380> \{[Mari]}
<0381> "There is no message from Takami-sama.
<0382> However, according to the schedule I heard yesterday,
<0383> \ Takami-sama will be in the annex this morning."
<0384> \{[Mari]}
<0385> "If you have urgent business with Takami-sama,
<0386> \ I think it would be best to meet in the morning.
<0387> \ You seem to be a busy person..."
<0388> \{［伶］}
<0389> "I see. Thank you."
<0390> \{[Mari]}
<0391> "When Lady Rei has business with Lady Takami,
<0392> \ Please put me through immediately,
<0393> \ I have received strict orders from Takami-sama.
<0394> \{[Mari]}
<0395> "If you are visiting the Annex,
<0396> \ To avoid misunderstandings,
<0397> \ I will contact Takami-sama now..."
<0398> \{［伶］}
<0399> "No, it's fine. I don't have any particular business with Takami.
<0400> \ I might visit if I feel like it,
<0401> \ For now, I have no intention of doing so.
<0402> \{[Mari]}
<0403> "Yes. Understood."
<0404> \{[Mari]}
<0405> "Even so, to Takami-sama, Rei-sama,
<0406> \ You are a very important customer."
<0407> \{[Mari]}
<0408> "More than any other guest who has ever visited the museum,
<0409> \ Please welcome Rei-sama with courtesy,
<0410> \ It was communicated to everyone working at the mansion."
<0411> \{［伶］}
<0412> "...Takami must really not want me to escape.
<0413> \ Now, I wonder what intentions he's hiding."
<0414> \{[Mari]}
<0415> "Rei-sama, did you say something?"
<0416> \{［伶］}
<0417> "No. Nothing."
<0418> I grabbed a few still-warm butter rolls,
<0419> I nibbled on some consomme soup and fresh herb salad.
<0420> Rei's breakfast is finished.
<0421> Put away the empty dishes,
<0422> He poured tea from the teapot and placed it in front of Rei,
<0423> Marie tilts her head and asks.
<0424> \{[Mari]}
<0425> "Rei-sama, what will you do now?"
<0426> \{［伶］}
<0427> "That's right. Now, what should we do now?
<0428> \ Where did I start..."
<0429> Takami's mysterious words,
<0430> This sparked a bit of curiosity in my heart.
<0431> As if being pushed from behind,
<0432> I was brought to the mansion almost by force.
<0433> "As your master, do as you please."
<0434> Takami kindly recommended it.
<0435> However, regarding how to spend time at the mansion,
<0436> There was no way Rei had any concrete plans.
<0437> \{［伶］}
<0438> "What do you think, Marie? About my actions today,
<0439> \ Haven't you received any instructions from Takami?
<0440> \{[Mari]}
<0441> "Just take care of Rei-sama..."
<0442> \ That's what I'm saying.
<0443> \ I haven't heard anything else."
<0444> \{[Mari]}
<0445> "But, yes... Since we're here, let's spend the morning
<0446> \ Why don't you patrol the mansion?
<0447> \{[Mari]}
<0448> "This mansion is quite spacious both inside and out,
<0449> \ I think it'll also be good exercise after a meal."
<0450> \{［伶］}
<0451> "That's true..."
<0452> Patrol the mansion
<0453> Exit the mansion
<0454> Return to room
<0455> I'll be spending some time here,
<0456> What is daily life like at the museum?
<0457> It's not a bad idea to see it with your own eyes first.
<0458> \{［伶］}
<0459> "If I'm the master of the mansion,
<0460> \ I'll try and do something similar.
<0461> \ I'll look around the mansion.
<0462> \{[Mari]}
<0463> "May I show you around?"
<0464> \{［伶］}
<0465> "No. I want to check it out by myself.
<0466> \ I don't need directions.
<0467> \{［伶］}
<0468> "That's enough here.
<0469> \ I'll take a proper rest and then leave as I please,
<0470> \ You should go back to your usual work."
<0471> \{[Mari]}
<0472> "I understand. I will now excuse myself.
<0473> \ I'm in the building,
<0474> \ Please call me whenever you need me."
<0475> \{[Mari]}
<0476> "Lunch will be served at twelve o'clock.
<0477> \ Please come to the dining room when the time comes.
<0478> After bowing and saying goodbye,
<0479> Marie quietly pushed the cart loaded with dishes,
<0480> He quietly left the room.
<0481> Enjoy the aroma of the tea brewed by Marie,
<0482> Rei enjoyed the relaxing time for a while,
<0483> When the cup is empty, I get up from my seat.
<0484> \{［伶］}
<0485> "Now, what should I do...?"
<0486> Hallway
<0487> Reception room
<0488> Entrance hall
<0489> Return to room
<0490> To patrol the building,
<0491> Rei decided to walk around all the corridors in the mansion.
<0492> Occasionally, a maid would come in carrying piles of sheets and cleaning supplies.
<0493> I saw Rei walking down the hallway,
<0494> They respectfully refrain from coming and going,
<0495> The hall is enveloped in a considerate silence.
<0496> I saw this while passing by.
<0497> A maid carefully polishes the picture frame on the wall.
<0498> Rei tried calling out to him.
<0499> \{［伶］}
<0500> "Taking care of artworks is a painstaking job.
<0501> \ Do you do that every day, polishing the artworks in the museum?"
<0502> The maid, who found out that the man was the new owner of the mansion,
<0503> He stopped working, turned around, and answered politely.
<0504> \{[Maid]}
<0505> "Well, things that require careful care,
<0506> \ I take care of it every day.
<0507> \{［伶］}
<0508> "Yeah. Sounds like a lot of work."
<0509> \{[Maid]}
<0510> "Something like this,
<0511> \ It's within reach,
<0512> \ It's not too hard to maintain.
<0513> \{[Maid]}
<0514> "The only thing that requires much more daily care than this is
<0515> \ It is highly valued as an antique work of art,
<0516> \ It's a large piece, displayed in a hard-to-reach place."
<0517> \{[Maid]}
<0518> "For example, the chandelier in the entrance hall..."
<0519> \{［伶］}
<0520> "Ah, it was hanging from the ceiling as soon as we entered the mansion.
<0521> \ It certainly was a magnificent chandelier."
<0522> \{[Maid]}
<0523> "Yes, it seems to be an item that was used in European castles."
<0524> \{[Maid]}
<0525> "It is a masterpiece made in the Middle Ages,
<0526> \ It seems to be quite heavy, so maintenance was difficult.
<0527> \{[Maid]}
<0528> "If you don't reinforce the mounting points once a year,
<0529> \ Sometimes it falls..."
<0530> \{［伶］}
<0531> "...It looks good, but
<0532> \ It must be quite a hassle to maintain."
<0533> \{[Maid]}
<0534> "At Takami-sama's suggestion, by using a switch on the wall,
<0535> \ It was motorized so that the chandelier could be lowered from the ceiling,
<0536> \ Daily maintenance is no longer as problematic as it used to be.
<0537> \{[Maid]}
<0538> "This mansion may look quite old-fashioned at first glance,
<0539> \ While being careful not to damage the appearance,
<0540> \ The upgrades are being made inconspicuously."
<0541> \{［伶］}
<0542> "I see..."
<0543> I was satisfied with the polite service that showed the thorough education.
<0544> When I left the maid's side,
<0545> Rei walked through the hallways of the mansion again.
<0546> I took a quick look around the hallways of the building,
<0547> You won't come across anything new or unusual.
<0548> Look around the hallway a bit more
<0549> Go somewhere else
<0550> \{［伶］}
<0551> (……?)
<0552> As I walked further down the corridor,
<0553> Suddenly, Rei noticed a place in the back of the room.
<0554> I noticed an old staircase.
<0555> The steps lead to the upper floors,
<0556> At the end of the road,
<0557> As if refusing to allow anyone who is not allowed to pass,
<0558> A large partition blocks the entrance.
<0559> \{［伶］}
<0560> (Does it lead to the attic...?)
<0561> It gives off a sense of mystery.
<0562> The closed door,
<0563> Rei, curious, gazed up the stairs.
<0564> \{［伶］}
<0565> "Hey, you there."
<0566> \{[Maid]}
<0567> "Yes, how can I help you?"
<0568> A maid who was cleaning the windows nearby said,
<0569> He comes in response to Rei's call.
<0570> \{［伶］}
<0571> "The end of these stairs seems to be blocked off,
<0572> \ Is it forbidden to pass through here?
<0573> \{[Maid]}
<0574> "Yes, that's right.
<0575> \ We are forbidden to enter.
<0576> \{[Maid]}
<0577> "These stairs are no longer in use.
<0578> \ It leads to the attic..."
<0579> \{[Maid]}
<0580> "I've never used these stairs either,
<0581> \ I don't know the details.
<0582> \{［伶］}
<0583> "...I see. I understand, thank you."
<0584> \{［伶］}
<0585> (I think this is enough.
<0586> \ Well, I guess it's time to head elsewhere...)
<0587> Rei thought about what to do next.
<0588> On patrol inside the building,
<0589> Rei decided to head to the reception room for the time being.
<0590> I visited the reception room that Takami had guided me to,
<0591> There is no one there.
<0592> The interior of the room was exactly as it was yesterday.
<0593> There's nothing to check here,
<0594> It seemed to be announcing this to everyone who visited the room.
<0595> I decided to investigate the room, which had nothing worth seeing.
<0596> Rei quickly gives up.
<0597> \{［伶］}
<0598> (Now, what should I do next...?)
<0599> To look around the building,
<0600> Rei decided to head to the entrance hall.
<0601> As I walked alone through the mansion, I realized,
<0602> This is a mansion with a small number of servants considering the size of the facility,
<0603> Perhaps the employees are well trained,
<0604> He is extremely considerate so as not to make his master uncomfortable.
<0605> I sense the presence of people working here and there,
<0606> No one makes enough noise to disturb Rei's thoughts.
<0607> It's a thoughtful and appreciated gesture.
<0608> When Rei stepped into the entrance hall,
<0609> There, holding a can of wax and a piece of cloth,
<0610> The work of polishing the wainscoting that covers the lower part of the hall wall,
<0611> Marie was seen working wholeheartedly.
<0612> Kneeling, bending at the waist,
<0613> Waxing the wainscoting that has turned amber over the years,
<0614> Carefully polish it with the cloth in your hand.
<0615> This monotonous task doesn't seem interesting at all.
<0616> Marie tells him that she is having a great time.
<0617> With a carefree smile, he continues working enthusiastically as he had been doing for a while now.
<0618> What's so fun about that?
<0619> It makes you want to ask questions and seek answers.
<0620> That smile, without a cloud.
<0621> Call out
<0622> Don't call out
<0623> \{［伶］}
<0624> "...I was just cleaning the mansion,
<0625> \ What's so fun about that?
<0626> Driven by curiosity, Rei instinctively called out to Marie.
<0627> Marie stopped polishing the board and said,
<0628> With a happy smile still on his face, he looks up at Rei.
<0629> \{[Mari]}
<0630> "This is how you take care of it.
<0631> \ It seems to help prolong the life of the mansion.
<0632> \{[Mari]}
<0633> "These hands of mine,
<0634> \ I can't believe I can help keep the mansion alive.
<0635> \ That's wonderful!
<0636> \{[Mari]}
<0637> "If you think like that, even the smallest deeds you do towards the mansion,
<0638> \ It all turned out to be fun for me."
<0639> \{［伶］}
<0640> "...I've never thought of it that way,
<0641> \ I don't really understand,
<0642> \ You seem to like the mansion very much."
<0643> \{[Mari]}
<0644> "Yes! I love this mansion."
<0645> \{[Mari]}
<0646> "Having lived through many eras, what has arrived at the present time is
<0647> \ If you take care of it with care and love,
<0648> \ I'm sure he will continue to respond to our feelings in the future."
<0649> \{[Mari]}
<0650> "It's the same with a mansion. If you put your heart and soul into it,
<0651> \ Someday, that feeling will reside in this mansion,
<0652> \ It responds by creating a comfortable atmosphere that envelops this place.
<0653> \{［伶］}
<0654> "If you put your feelings into it, even inorganic objects will respond to those feelings--"
<0655> That's ridiculous
<0656> Interesting
<0657> \{［伶］}
<0658> "That's ridiculous. Your ideas are nothing more than childish fantasies.
<0659> \ It is impossible for human thoughts to reside in inanimate objects.
<0660> \{[Mari]}
<0661> "Ah..."
<0662> \{[Mari]}
<0663> "I see... I see. Um, I'm sorry.
<0664> \ Tell me a boring story."
<0665> \{[Mari]}
<0666> "...Ah! I'm sorry,
<0667> \ You're interrupting Rei-sama's patrol."
<0668> A smile hides the hurt in her eyes,
<0669> Marie gives me a gentle smile.
<0670> For some reason, that expression made me feel uneasy.
<0671> Rei instinctively looked away.
<0672> \{［伶］}
<0673> "No... I'm the one who interrupted.
<0674> \ Don't worry about me, just get on with your work."
<0675> \{[Mari]}
<0676> "Yes. I'll be off then."
<0677> I bowed to Rei,
<0678> Marie once again polishes the waistboard with the cloth in her hand.
<0679> Back to waxing.
<0680> Having lost any reason to stay there any longer, Rei
<0681> I left Marie and headed out the entrance hall.
<0682> Rei can pick up fragments of people's thoughts,
<0683> Those words somehow felt right.
<0684> I have never experienced sensing someone's thoughts from an object,
<0685> If the same feelings continue to pour down like an endless rain,
<0686> Eventually, inorganic objects also became targets.
<0687> Perhaps it is a memory of accumulated feelings.
<0688> \{［伶］}
<0689> "...That's an interesting opinion.
<0690> \ I can somewhat understand that feeling.
<0691> \{[Mari]}
<0692> "I see! It's great to hear you say that, Rei-sama.
<0693> \ I'm so happy...!
<0694> \{[Mari]}
<0695> "It's precisely because the mansion is old,
<0696> \ I will polish it with even more care,
<0697> \ I want to treasure it."
<0698> Marie is working happily,
<0699> I just couldn't bring myself to call out to her,
<0700> Rei left the place in silence.
<0701> \{［伶］}
<0702> (…… Should I go back to my room?)
<0703> Rei finished her patrol and
<0704> I decided to return to the room that had been prepared for me.
<0705> And then all the way through until lunchtime,
<0706> Rei locks herself in her room,
<0707> I devoted myself to clearing the mountain of unread books in my library.
<0708> When I turned my eyes, I saw the pleasant sunlight,
<0709> Light is streaming in quietly through the window.
<0710> The view through the window seems to invite the viewer to go outside.
<0711> The clear, refreshing May sky stretches out before you.
<0712> \{［伶］}
<0713> "...I'd like to know the state of the land around here,
<0714> \ I'll take a walk around the mansion.
<0715> \{[Mari]}
<0716> "I see! To learn about life in the mansion,
<0717> \ That might be a good idea.
<0718> \ Would you like us to assign someone who is familiar with the area to guide you?
<0719> \{［伶］}
<0720> "No... I want to walk alone, so I don't need a guide.
<0721> \ I don't intend to go so far that I get lost."
<0722> \{[Mari]}
<0723> "Yes, I understand."
<0724> \{[Mari]}
<0725> "Fortunately, today until evening,
<0726> \ It seems the weather will stay like this for a while.
<0727> \ You can go out without any worries.
<0728> \{［伶］}
<0729> "Right. Well then, I'm off."
<0730> \{[Mari]}
<0731> "Have a nice trip, Rei-sama! Be careful."
<0732> Rei leaves the mansion with Marie seeing her off.
<0733> I have some time alone and wander around the mansion to my heart's content.
<0734> Go see Takami
<0735> Return to room
<0736> Then, on a whim,
<0737> I thought I'd drop by Takami's place.
<0738> That's the thought that occurred to me.
<0739> Takami's expression of surprise at Rei's sudden visit,
<0740> It would be fun to check it out.
<0741> Rei headed towards the annex where Takami was.
<0742> I followed the indicated path for about fifteen minutes,
<0743> The roof of a building appears through the shade of the tall, spreading branches of the forest.
<0744> There is only one road to the building, so you won't get lost.
<0745> Soon Rei arrived at her destination.
<0746> Rei rang the doorbell to inform the servant that she had arrived.
<0747> Takami rushed over in a hurry,
<0748> \ruby{Pantasy}={Dismay} caused his voice to crack and pierce.
<0749> \{[Takami]}
<0750> "Rei! Why are you here?!"
<0751> \{［伶］}
<0752> "If you feel like it, you can come.
<0753> \ Weren't you the one who invited me?
<0754> \ I've come all the way to visit you. I hope you'll let me in.
<0755> \{[Takami]}
<0756> "Ah, yeah..."
<0757> The annex where Takami is staying is different from the mansion where Rei lives with Nozomi.
<0758> It was a fairly small mansion.
<0759> There seemed to be few servants, and while Takami was showing me around the mansion,
<0760> Rei saw no one other than the person who answered the door.
<0761> \{［伶］}
<0762> "You seem to be living a more stable life than I thought.
<0763> \ Because it's you, I want to keep on loving you.
<0764> \ I thought you were living a wealthy and flashy life."
<0765> \{[Takami]}
<0766> "......"
<0767> \{［伶］}
<0768> "What's wrong, Takami?
<0769> \ You've been looking uneasy for a while now.
<0770> \ Is there something bothering you?
<0771> \{[Takami]}
<0772> "...You really came all the way to me,
<0773> \ I'm surprised because I didn't expect you to come visit.
<0774> \{［伶］}
<0775> "Oh, my apologies. I'm sorry to have startled you."
<0776> \{[Takami]}
<0777> "Hey, Rei! What's your purpose in coming here?
<0778> \ What on earth are you planning?"
<0779> \{［伶］}
<0780> "Don't think I'm plotting anything... I only came because you invited me.
<0781> \ I find it disappointing that people are saying there is some kind of plot.
<0782> \{[Takami]}
<0783> "Even if you say it with that smile, it's not convincing!
<0784> \ There must be some kind of motive behind this.
<0785> \ Otherwise, there would be no reason for you to visit me."
<0786> \{［伶］}
<0787> "That's a problem, even if you say that, I don't have any particular goal in mind.
<0788> \ I wonder if you'll believe me."
<0789> \{[Takami]}
<0790> "How can I trust a word you say?"
<0791> \{［伶］}
<0792> "You're the same as always. When it comes to me,
<0793> \ I'm always more suspicious than necessary.
<0794> \ That part hasn't changed at all since the old days.
<0795> \{[Takami]}
<0796> "It's because I grew up seeing you so close!
<0797> \ Others will be fooled by your words and actions,
<0798> \ I won't be fooled."
<0799> \{[Takami]}
<0800> "You've always looked down on me..."
<0801> \{［伶］}
<0802> "...Takami. You are saying to me,
<0803> \ It seems like you're hiding something really shameful."
<0804> \{[Takami]}
<0805> "Eh...!"
<0806> \{［伶］}
<0807> "If you keep on doubting like that,
<0808> \ I wonder if there's something inconvenient about me being here.
<0809> \ I can't help but suspect something wrong.
<0810> \{[Takami]}
<0811> "No, it's not like that..."
<0812> \{［伶］}
<0813> "So it's okay for me to be here?"
<0814> \{[Takami]}
<0815> "Ah, yeah. That's right."
<0816> \{［伶］}
<0817> "Well, then, will you be so kind as to give me a warm welcome?
<0818> \ I'm a guest who came to visit you."
<0819> \{［伶］}
<0820> "The thoughtfulness of offering a cup of tea to a guest,
<0821> \ I don't have any expectations of you, so don't worry.
<0822> \{[Takami]}
<0823> "--! That's what pisses me off about you!"
<0824> I don't dislike your impulsiveness.
<0825> Say nothing
<0826> \{［伶］}
<0827> "I like your straightforwardness,
<0828> \ I don't really dislike it."
<0829> \{[Takami]}
<0830> "...!"
<0831> Perhaps Rei's words were too unexpected,
<0832> Takami's eyes widened in surprise,
<0833> I stand there in shock, my mouth open and at a loss for words.
<0834> After muttering some meaningless words,
<0835> Takami swallowed hard,
<0836> Without taking his eyes off Rei, he asked seriously.
<0837> \{[Takami]}
<0838> "Why did you come to see me...?"
<0839> \{［伶］}
<0840> "......"
<0841> \{[Takami]}
<0842> "You don't even want to deal with me? What a nasty guy...!"
<0843> Without taking his eyes off Rei, who was glaring at him hatefully,
<0844> Takami asked quietly.
<0845> \{[Takami]}
<0846> "...Why did you come to see me?"
<0847> \{［伶］}
<0848> "I just wanted to talk to you once in a while."
<0849> \{[Takami]}
<0850> "Don't dodge like that!
<0851> \ Tell me the real reason you came to see me."
<0852> \{［伶］}
<0853> "Even if you say the real reason..."
<0854> It's just a whim
<0855> I came because I wanted to see you.
<0856> \{［伶］}
<0857> "Don't worry about it. It's just a whim.
<0858> \ It has no further meaning."
<0859> \{[Takami]}
<0860> "Whimsical..."
<0861> \{［伶］}
<0862> "Oh, you look very dissatisfied.
<0863> \ What kind of answer did you expect from me?
<0864> \{［伶］}
<0865> "Ah... there's a special meaning behind me coming to see you.
<0866> \ Did you want me to answer?
<0867> \ I should have said, "I want to hear your voice."
<0868> \{[Takami]}
<0869> "! Don't make fun of me!
<0870> \ I don't want to hear you say that!
<0871> \{［伶］}
<0872> "If you deny it too much,
<0873> \ It looks like you're hitting the nail on the head, Takami.
<0874> \{[Takami]}
<0875> "...!"
<0876> \{[Takami]}
<0877> "I have work to do now.
<0878> \ Unlike you who have too much free time on your hands, I'm busy.
<0879> \ If you're just here to bother me, then go away!
<0880> \{［伶］}
<0881> "Yeah. I feel better after teasing you.
<0882> \ I've killed some time, so I'll leave now."
<0883> \{[Takami]}
<0884> "...Rei. Please continue investigating Nozomi."
<0885> \{［伶］}
<0886> "Now, what should I do?"
<0887> \{[Takami]}
<0888> "Hey!"
<0889> \{［伶］}
<0890> "I'm not keen on doing what you want me to do.
<0891> \ I'll do as I please.
<0892> \ If that doesn't satisfy you, then I'll leave the mansion."
<0893> \{［伶］}
<0894> "I have all the choices."
<0895> \{[Takami]}
<0896> "......"
<0897> \{［伶］}
<0898> "......"
<0899> \{[Takami]}
<0900> "...I get it. Do as you like."
<0901> \{［伶］}
<0902> "Aren't you angry, Takami?"
<0903> \{[Takami]}
<0904> "You're not the type of person to listen to what I force you to do.
<0905> \ It's unbearable when someone gets upset.
<0906> \ It's better to let your curiosity take over."
<0907> \{［伶］}
<0908> "...I'm surprised."
<0909> \{［伶］}
<0910> "It seems you're quite serious,
<0911> \ It seems like you want to keep me in that mansion.
<0912> \ I wonder what you're hiding from me."
<0913> \{[Takami]}
<0914> "It's a mutual thing.
<0915> \ Well, you should be that nervous,
<0916> \ It won't be boring, right?
<0917> \{［伶］}
<0918> "Yes, you may be right."
<0919> \{[Takami]}
<0920> "Well then, let's hurry up and return to the mansion.
<0921> \ There's no progress to be made by sticking to me here."
<0922> \{［伶］}
<0923> "Yes, I'll do that.
<0924> \ It's boring to look at your face."
<0925> Takami was not given a chance to utter abusive words.
<0926> Rei quickly left the room.
<0927> A few moments later, an angry voice followed Rei,
<0928> I left the annex without paying any attention to him.
<0929> Rei returned the way she had come and soon arrived at the mansion,
<0930> I couldn't bring myself to follow Takami's words.
<0931> I didn't visit Nozomi's room.
<0932> Rei went straight back to her room,
<0933> I'll stay there until it's lunchtime,
<0934> I devoted myself to clearing the mountain of unread books in my library.
<0935> \{［伶］}
<0936> "Do I need a reason to come and see you?
<0937> \ I just wanted to see you, so I came over."
<0938> \{[Takami]}
<0939> "Did you miss me? You... to me...?!"
<0940> \{［伶］}
<0941> "That's right. We didn't have a chance to talk at length.
<0942> \ I wanted to talk to you for a bit.
<0943> \ ...Is there something you're unhappy about?"
<0944> \{[Takami]}
<0945> "N-no, I'm not complaining or anything..."
<0946> \{［伶］}
<0947> "Right. That's good.
<0948> \ If you don't mind, there's no problem.
<0949> \{[Takami]}
<0950> "......"
<0951> \{[Takami]}
<0952> "...What do you intend to find out from me, Rei?
<0953> \ I'll state this in advance,
<0954> \ I'm not going to talk about hope.
<0955> \{［伶］}
<0956> "I never expected anything like that in the first place.
<0957> \ You're surprisingly tight-lipped.
<0958> \ I have no intention of asking you anything I have no intention of revealing.
<0959> \{[Takami]}
<0960> "Don't waste your time on useless things... so that's what it means.
<0961> \ A wise decision."
<0962> \{［伶］}
<0963> "You don't have to force it, as long as you have enough information to make a judgment.
<0964> \ I can pretty much read your mind.
<0965> \ I won't be so rude as to ask you for the answer itself."
<0966> \{［伶］}
<0967> "This is a place that has been prepared for me to kill time.
<0968> \ To enjoy the full time,
<0969> \ I need that much of a handicap."
<0970> \{[Takami]}
<0971> "...!"
<0972> \{［伶］}
<0973> "Even if you don't reveal it, I will eventually arrive at the answer.
<0974> \ I'm in no hurry to solve the mystery."
<0975> \{[Takami]}
<0976> "Rei! You're such a jerk!"
<0977> \{［伶］}
<0978> "I'm honored to hear you say that.
<0979> \ I feel like I'm being praised.
<0980> \{[Takami]}
<0981> "You idiot...!"
<0982> My reaction was not much different from when I was a child.
<0983> I saw Takami blushing in indignation at Rei's words,
<0984> A sudden fit of laughter erupts.
<0985> \{［伶］}
<0986> "...huh."
<0987> Holding her mouth, Rei somehow managed to withstand the first wave,
<0988> Unable to contain the rising sense of humor,
<0989> His shoulders begin to shake and he begins to chuckle.
<0990> \{[Takami]}
<0991> "...Hey. What are you laughing at, Rei?
<0992> \ Are you making fun of me again?
<0993> Takami's expression was sullen as he asked the question.
<0994> Rei teases him and he gets sulky.
<0995> Because her expression was the same as when she was a child,
<0996> Once again, Rei is overcome by a fit of uncontrollable laughter.
<0997> \{[Takami]}
<0998> "Hey, Rei...!"
<0999> \{［伶］}
<1000> "Oh - no. I wasn't making fun of you.
<1001> \ Talking to you like this,
<1002> \ It's been a really long time since we last met..."
<1003> \{［伶］}
<1004> "But you haven't changed at all since the old days.
<1005> \ It was a little nostalgic... and very funny."
<1006> \{[Takami]}
<1007> "......"
<1008> \{［伶］}
<1009> "Your face hasn't changed at all..."
<1010> \{[Takami]}
<1011> "...Hey, how long are you going to keep laughing?
<1012> \ Stop laughing already!
<1013> \ If you're not willing to have a proper conversation, then go home!
<1014> \{［伶］}
<1015> "Oh... sorry."
<1016> \{[Takami]}
<1017> "So what are you planning to talk to me about now?
<1018> \ Unlike you who have free time, I am busy.
<1019> \ Once you're satisfied, just go home!
<1020> \{［伶］}
<1021> "That's right. I'm sorry to disturb you any further.
<1022> \ I'll excuse myself for now."
<1023> \{[Takami]}
<1024> "...What? Are you going home already?"
<1025> \{［伶］}
<1026> "Oh, that's a shame."
<1027> \{[Takami]}
<1028> "No, you were the one who wanted to talk.
<1029> \ Since you said you were going to go home without doing anything, I..."
<1030> \{［伶］}
<1031> "If I feel like it, I'll come and see you again.
<1032> \ The one who will be playing with you is
<1033> \ Please forgive me until then. -- I'm sorry.
<1034> \{[Takami]}
<1035> "Hey, I don't really care,
<1036> \ I want you to be my partner..."
<1037> \{［伶］}
<1038> "Well, see you later, Takami."
<1039> \{[Takami]}
<1040> "...Hey, listen to what people are saying!"
<1041> Rei ignored Takami's cries of protest with a cheerful smile.
<1042> The door was quickly closed in front of Takami's nose as he approached.
<1043> He refutes every word Rei says with anger.
<1044> Takami's reaction was funny,
<1045> I ended up teasing him childishly.
<1046> However, after a long time of interacting with Takami,
<1047> It was actually surprisingly comfortable.
<1048> Rei's steps were strangely light as she returned to the mansion.
<1049> After leaving Takami, Rei returned straight to the mansion.
<1050> The short time until lunch,
<1051> Spent the time clearing out the pile of unread books.
<1052> Suddenly, what I was doing seemed ridiculous.
<1053> The slight interest I had suddenly faded,
<1054> I no longer have the energy to wander around the mansion.
<1055> \{［伶］}
<1056> (There's no obligation to patrol.
<1057> \ ... Should I go back?)
<1058> Rei turned around and said,
<1059> I returned to the room given to me for him.
<1060> And then all the way through until lunchtime,
<1061> Rei shut herself up in her room,
<1062> I devoted myself to clearing the mountain of unread books in my library.
<1063> At the place where I was brought reluctantly,
<1064> Children of unknown identity,
<1065> I don't have the energy to investigate a mansion where I don't know who is there.
<1066> It doesn't look like it's going to come out at all.
<1067> I had no desire to go along with Takami's plan.
<1068> Rei answered Marie's question with a careless attitude.
<1069> \{［伶］}
<1070> "... I'll go back to my room. I'll spend my time however I like,
<1071> \ Don't get in the way."
<1072> \{[Mari]}
<1073> "Yes, I understand.
<1074> \ I will try not to disturb you,
<1075> \ Please call me whenever you need me."
<1076> Leaving Marie behind, bowing respectfully,
<1077> Rei left the dining room.
<1078> Rei went straight back to the room that had been prepared for her.
<1079> Until it was time for lunch,
<1080> I shut myself up in my room,
<1081> I devoted myself to clearing the mountain of unread books in my library.
