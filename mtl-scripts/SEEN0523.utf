#character '[Takami]'
#character '[Rei]'

<0000> The evening twilight passes in the blink of an eye,
<0001> After Rei accepted Takami's invitation and stayed at this mansion,
<0002> The fourth night has come.
<0003> I had an appointment with Takami that night,
<0004> After dinner, Rei headed straight to the annex where Takami lived.
<0005> \{[Takami]}
<0006> "I'm glad you came and didn't break your promise.
<0007> \ Well, first of all, just sit down wherever you like.
<0008> \ I'll prepare some drinks and snacks right away. Please wait.
<0009> \{[Rei]}
<0010> "Yeah. I'll just relax here."
<0011> As soon as Rei visited the annex,
<0012> Takami appeared at the front door to greet the guests.
<0013> From that very fact alone, I can say that Rei's visit tonight
<0014> It was clear that Takami had been waiting impatiently for this.
<0015> I feel uneasy.
<0016> So, Rei tried to avoid any roundabout conversations,
<0017> He started the conversation straight out.
<0018> \{[Rei]}
<0019> "...Takami. What are you talking about?"
<0020> \{[Takami]}
<0021> "......"
<0022> \{[Takami]}
<0023> "Today... I'm sorry.
<0024> \ Thanks to you, I was saved."
<0025> \{[Takami]}
<0026> "It seems that while I was down and causing a commotion,
<0027> \ It seems there was a plan to kidnap Nozomi..."
<0028> \{[Takami]}
<0029> "Well, fortunately, it was prevented before it happened.
<0030> \ Thanks to this, the investigation of the people involved in this matter,
<0031> \ The investigation into the other maid informants is going smoothly.
<0032> \{[Takami]}
<0033> "This will give me peace of mind for the time being. Thank you."
<0034> \{[Rei]}
<0035> "For the time being..."
<0036> \{[Rei]}
<0037> "--Around you,
<0038> \ Does that happen often?
<0039> \{[Takami]}
<0040> "It's rare to see something so obvious,
<0041> \ Well, sometimes...
<0042> \{[Takami]}
<0043> "When you deal with greedy customers,
<0044> \ This kind of thing happens all the time.
<0045> \{[Takami]}
<0046> "Ah, now that I think about it, my father's accident was also
<0047> \ It may be more natural to think that this was the work of someone trying to kill him.
<0048> \{[Rei]}
<0049> "...Doesn't it get too hard?"
<0050> \{[Takami]}
<0051> "--Occasionally, you know."
<0052> \{[Takami]}
<0053> "It's not a family business I wanted to take over, but as the head of the Kujo family,
<0054> I have a responsibility to fulfill."
<0055> \{[Takami]}
<0056> "There are times when I feel like just throwing it away,
<0057> \ When I think about the people involved,
<0058> I can't abandon the Kujo family or my job."
<0059> \{[Rei]}
<0060> "I see..."
<0061> \{[Takami]}
<0062> “--Rei. Why did you protect me today?
<0063> \ Even taking such a risk..."
<0064> \{[Rei]}
<0065> "Why did you have to protect me?
<0066> \ Did you stand in front of the knife?
<0067> \{[Takami]}
<0068> "...The moment I thought you were in danger,
<0069> \ My body moved on its own.
<0070> \ But I couldn't help it--"
<0071> \{[Takami]}
<0072> "I think it was only because of you that he did this."
<0073> \{[Rei]}
<0074> "......"
<0075> \{[Takami]}
<0076> "After I realized that,
<0077> \ I thought about our relationship.
<0078> \{[Rei]}
<0079> "Our... relationship?"
<0080> \{[Takami]}
<0081> "We lived closest to each other, but we weren't family.
<0082> \ Although we don't have strong blood ties,
<0083> \ It's not like we're complete strangers.
<0084> \{[Takami]}
<0085> "Not just a friend, not just a brother-in-law."
<0086> \{[Takami]}
<0087> "There seems to be something between us,
<0088> \ Actuallyーnothing.”
<0089> \{[Takami]}
<0090> "All we have is a thing spun by other hands,
<0091> \ Only an illusory connection..."
<0092> \{[Rei]}
<0093> "Yes... you're right.
<0094> \ Now that I think about it, it was a very fleeting thing.
<0095> \ What is the relationship between you and me?
<0096> \{[Rei]}
<0097> "Somehowーit can break,
<0098> \ I never thought about it.
<0099> \{[Takami]}
<0100> "...Me too.
<0101> \ But latelyーI think about it a lot.”
<0102> \{[Rei]}
<0103> "......"
<0104> \{[Takami]}
<0105> “Rei. What do you think of me?”
<0106> \{[Takami]}
<0107> "I've always thought you hated me.
<0108> \ So thoroughly that there is no room for reconciliation..."
<0109> \{[Takami]}
<0110> "But at that moment, you helped me without any hesitation.
<0111> \ Even at the risk of my own life!
<0112> \{[Takami]}
<0113> "Why? Why didn't you abandon me?"
<0114> \{[Rei]}
<0115> "I hate you, don't I?"
<0116> \{[Rei]}
<0117> "That's not true.
<0118> \ It's not that I hated you that much.
<0119> \ Rather, wasn't it you who hated me?
<0120> \{[Takami]}
<0121> "I hated you more than you...!?"
<0122> \{[Rei]}
<0123> "That's right. When they see me, they attack me,
<0124> \ It seems you can't help but find fault with my actions,
<0125> \ I thought you really disliked me."
<0126> \{[Takami]}
<0127> "What are you saying? You're the one who's insulting me,
<0128> \ Because you ignore it.
<0129> \ That made me so angry that I--!"
<0130> \{[Rei]}
<0131> "...Takami..."
<0132> \{[Rei]}
<0133> "I don't despise you.
<0134> \ I didn't mean to ignore you."
<0135> \{[Rei]}
<0136> "But back then, I didn't have the ability to accept others.
<0137> \ I didn't have the mental capacity to do so.
<0138> \{[Rei]}
<0139> "As a result, I, in particular,
<0140> \ I've been acting cold towards you,
<0141> \ I might have taken it.
<0142> \{[Rei]}
<0143> "If my attitude has irritated you,
<0144> \ I'm sorry..."
<0145> \{[Takami]}
<0146> "......"
<0147> \{[Rei]}
<0148> "......"
<0149> \{[Takami]}
<0150> "...That means,
<0151> \ You didn't really hate me, did you?"
<0152> \{[Rei]}
<0153> "Yes, that's right."
<0154> \{[Takami]}
<0155> "...Until now, we have been hated by others,
<0156> \ We both strongly believed that,
<0157> \ You're saying he threw away the opportunity for reconciliation?
<0158> \{[Rei]}
<0159> "I wonder if that's what's going to happen."
<0160> \{[Takami]}
<0161> "......"
<0162> \{[Takami]}
<0163> "So, I've been stubborn up until now,
<0164> \ That's just stupid..."
<0165> \{[Rei]}
<0166> "Well, now that the misunderstanding has been cleared up,
<0167> \ We are in this vain conflict,
<0168> \ Is there any reason why we should continue this in the future?
<0169> \{[Takami]}
<0170> "Uh...yeah. Well...that's certainly true..."
<0171> \{[Rei]}
<0172> "Hey Takami, I have a suggestion.
<0173> \ Would you listen to me?
<0174> \{[Takami]}
<0175> "...What is it? Tell me."
<0176> \{[Rei]}
<0177> "I might as well take this opportunity,
<0178> \ Why don't we start over from the beginning?
<0179> \{[Takami]}
<0180> "Starting over from the beginning? What on earth...?"
<0181> \{[Rei]}
<0182> "The mistake we made as children in our relationship,
<0183> \ Once again, from the moment we met,
<0184> \ I'm suggesting that you try again."
<0185> \{[Takami]}
<0186> "Since we met...?"
<0187> \{[Rei]}
<0188> "That's right. When we first met,
<0189> Eight years agoーthe day I was taken in by the Kujo family,
<0190> \ The moment you and I met
<0191> \{[Rei]}
<0192> "From that time on, our misunderstandings
<0193> \ It started, but..."
<0194> \{[Rei]}
<0195> "If only we hadn't made that initial mistake,
<0196> \ Our relationship had a more tranquil beginning,
<0197> \ It would have been a lot different than it is now."
<0198> \{[Rei]}
<0199> "Our relationship started off right,
<0200> \ Don't you want to know what it's going to be like?
<0201> \{[Takami]}
<0202> "Let's start our relationship over from the beginning..."
<0203> \{[Takami]}
<0204> "You... are serious,
<0205> Is that what you want... Rei?
<0206> \{[Rei]}
<0207> "Of course. That's why I'm proposing it.
<0208> \ Now, what do you want to do, Takami?
<0209> \ Will you refuse and say you don't want to do this? Or will you laugh it off and say it's a farce?
<0210> \{[Rei]}
<0211> "Or maybe--?"
<0212> \{[Takami]}
<0213> "I don't hate it...
<0214> \ If that's what you want too--I don't mind."
<0215> \{[Takami]}
<0216> "I want to start over with you too."
<0217> \{[Rei]}
<0218> "Then it's settled.
<0219> \ I'll completely let go of all the grudges I've had up until now,
<0220> \ Let's start our new relationship."
<0221> \{[Rei]}
<0222> "Well then, once again - nice to meet you, Takami."
<0223> \{[Takami]}
<0224> "Uh, yeah. Nice to meet you..."
<0225> \{[Rei]}
<0226> "Oh, that's right. I happen to have a glass of sake,
<0227> \ Shall we have a toast to celebrate our new beginning?
<0228> \{[Takami]}
<0229> "Wh-what's that..."
<0230> Takami raised his glass, muttering to himself.
<0231> By clinking the cups in their hands with a clear sound,
<0232> The two men took this as a sign of reconciliation.
<0233> \{[Rei]}
<0234> "Now we can start afresh--"
<0235> \{[Takami]}
<0236> "Yeah... that's right."
<0237> How should I handle this situation?
<0238> At first, Takami looked a little confused as he sipped his glass.
<0239> As the drinks flowed and the atmosphere became more relaxed,
<0240> He began to smile, not seeming completely opposed.
<0241> To let go of all the resentment that has been building up over the years,
<0242> Perhaps we both need a little time now.
<0243> However, as the beginning of a new relationship,
<0244> I think we got off to a pretty good start tonight.
<0245> The kind of things that friends would naturally exchange,
<0246> A simple, ordinary conversation,
<0247> I never thought I would be able to have such a friendly exchange with Takami.
<0248> I never imagined this until today when I was invited to the mansion.
<0249> \{[Rei]}
<0250> (But this isn't so bad either...)
<0251> Rei gave herself over to the pleasant intoxication,
<0252> I looked at Takami's slightly embarrassed, red face,
<0253> He smiled softly.
<0254> In the end, we all enjoyed a good drink together,
<0255> As we engaged in casual conversation,
<0256> I ended up talking with Takami until quite late.
<0257> I refused Takami's offer to send it.
<0258> Rei finally returned to the mansion after sobering up.
<0259> It was near dawn when the eastern sky was beginning to lighten.
