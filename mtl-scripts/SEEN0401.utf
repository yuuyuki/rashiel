<0000> May 5th Takami Route
<0001> \{[Takami]}
<0002> “--Rei!”
<0003> After finishing all her lessons for the day, Rei
<0004> As I walked down the long corridor of the dormitory, dyed in the colors of dusk,
<0005> A familiar voice called my name from behind.
<0006> There's no need to look back to check,
<0007> The owner of the voice was someone two years older than me and very close to me.
<0008> A third-year student who serves as the dormitory supervisor of this boys' school.
<0009> I realized it was none other than Kujo Takami.
<0010> Every time we met on campus or in the dormitory,
<0011> In response to Rei's disrespectful behavior, which is unbecoming of a first-year student,
<0012> Takami always nags me about anything.
<0013> Under the guise of "Advice from a senior to a junior,"
<0014> I wondered if Takami would complain about something again.
<0015> I feel a lot more tired after class, but there's nothing I can do about it.
<0016> Rei sighed and stopped walking.
<0017> \{［伶］}
<0018> "...Takami, huh? Is there something I can help you with?"
<0019> \{[Takami]}
<0020> "Hey, I told you to call me "senpai" in public!
<0021> \ As the dorm leader, this will be a disappointment to others!
<0022> \{［伶］}
<0023> "Right now, there's no one here except us.
<0024> \ Then it doesn't matter, right?
<0025> \{[Takami]}
<0026> "You've done that again..."
<0027> Takami started to say something but suddenly stopped.
<0028> His eyes widened in shock.
<0029> \{[Takami]}
<0030> "...Hey, Rei, what happened to that usual thing?"
<0031> \{［伶］}
<0032> "The usual...?"
<0033> \{[Takami]}
<0034> "I'm talking about the silver tie pin you always wear.
<0035> \ From the uniform tie,
<0036> \ You never took it off..."
<0037> As Takami pointed out, since entering the school,
<0038> The tie pin that I used to wear on my uniform tie every day,
<0039> This was the first time that Rei had missed a beat.
<0040> The stylishly designed silver tie pin worn by Rei is
<0041> It is an item that boys rarely wear,
<0042> He stood out quite a bit among the new first-year students.
<0043> However, the fact that it is not being worn now,
<0044> Takami's observational skills were quite sharp, as he noticed immediately.
<0045> \{[Takami]}
<0046> "You were wearing it when you left the dormitory this morning, right?
<0047> \ --What on earth happened?"
<0048> \{［伶］}
<0049> "Ah... it's gone."
<0050> \{[Takami]}
<0051> "It's gone!? Hey, what's going on?
<0052> \ Could it have been stolen by someone?
<0053> \{［伶］}
<0054> "...Maybe."
<0055> Takami's words made Rei, who had just finished gym class and returned to the classroom,
<0056> He looked at me with a nasty smile and a rude disdain.
<0057> The image of a certain group in class and the face of its central figure came to mind.
<0058> He is hostile towards Rei and always gets involved with her.
<0059> Perhaps it was done as part of a harassment scheme.
<0060> The meaning of that smile he had on his face was,
<0061> That's probably the case.
<0062> However, to Rei, his actions were,
<0063> It seemed so pointless.
<0064> \{[Takami]}
<0065> "Let's explain the situation to the teachers and have them check your belongings.
<0066> \ Anyone who does something so ridiculous,
<0067> \ I will definitely find him and punish him...!"
<0068> \{［伶］}
<0069> "Wait, Takami. Please don't make a fuss.
<0070> \ Even though I lost it, it wasn't anything particularly valuable.
<0071> \ I don't really care."
<0072> \{[Takami]}
<0073> "How stupid! That's your precious...!"
<0074> \{［伶］}
<0075> "As the owner, I don't mind if you lose it.
<0076> \ There's no need for you to worry."
<0077> \{［伶］}
<0078> "There's nothing I'd be embarrassed to lose..."
<0079> \{[Takami]}
<0080> "......"
<0081> In response to Rei's cold words,
<0082> Takami suddenly bit his lip as if trying to hold something back,
<0083> He bowed his head and his shoulders shook.
<0084> Takami remained silent without saying a word.
<0085> Rei calls out, feeling suspicious.
<0086> \{［伶］}
<0087> "Takami? Are you listening?"
<0088> \{[Takami]}
<0089> "...Okay, do as you please! I don't care anymore."
<0090> Takami yelled at Rei,
<0091> Then he walked away looking extremely angry.
<0092> Rei was left behind and wondered why Takami was so angry.
<0093> I couldn't understand that sentiment at all.
<0094> I could only stare blankly at the back of the uniform.
