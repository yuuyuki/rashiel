<0000> May 9th Takami Route
<0001> A clear, pleasant day is on the way.
<0002> It feels like a refreshing early summer morning.
<0003> As if called by that presence, Rei woke up.
<0004> \{［伶］}
<0005> "...Takami?!"
<0006> I opened my eyes and saw a scene that jumped straight into my eyes.
<0007> Rei's heart thumped loudly.
<0008> I didn't care that the sheets I was wearing were slipping off my skin.
<0009> Rei hurriedly sat up in bed.
<0010> --There's no one here.
<0011> The man who shared her love for him and was by his side until he lost consciousness,
<0012> Takami is nowhere to be seen.
<0013> I instinctively looked around, but there was nothing next to the bed.
<0014> Takami was nowhere to be seen in the room.
<0015> The warmth of our embrace fades away,
<0016> I touched the cold, crumpled sheets with my fingers,
<0017> I realize with my bare skin that there is no one next to me.
<0018> \{［伶］}
<0019> (Ahh, I see. …Takami too.)
<0020> When I woke up, there was no sign of anyone beside me.
<0021> I had experienced this several times and should have been prepared.
<0022> But, exposing your heart so naked and defenseless,
<0023> At the dawn of the day when our bodies were hot and passionate,
<0024> It was painful to know that we were parting without even being able to say "goodbye."
<0025> I have encountered similar situations many times before,
<0026> This time, it hit me especially hard.
<0027> I held my body, which was completely cold, as if the heat of last night had never happened.
<0028> Rei's heart freezes with hopeless despair.
<0029> --And then, at that moment.
<0030> Suddenly, the door to the room was slammed open without a knock.
<0031> \{［伶］}
<0032> "――!?"
<0033> \{[Takami]}
<0034> "--Huh? What's going on? You're awake too, Rei."
<0035> \{［伶］}
<0036> "Takami...?"
<0037> A cheerful voice came into the room,
<0038> A mug that gives off the aroma of fragrant coffee,
<0039> He skillfully closes the door while holding it in both hands.
<0040> Takami appeared to be in high spirits.
<0041> \{[Takami]}
<0042> "Hey!? Rei, what are you dressed like?
<0043> \ At least put on a sheet!
<0044> Takami's words brought me back to my senses,
<0045> With slightly unsteady fingers, I gather up the sheets.
<0046> \{[Takami]}
<0047> "It's a shame you were already awake.
<0048> \ I was looking forward to waking you up."
<0049> \{[Takami]}
<0050> "It was rare for you to show your defenseless sleeping face,
<0051> \ I was hoping to use that as a joke to make fun of him.
<0052> \ I should have taken a photo."
<0053> \{[Takami]}
<0054> "...Oops! I asked Marie, who came to wake you up,
<0055> \ I had some coffee made.
<0056> \ Here, here's your share too, so take it.
<0057> \{［伶］}
<0058> "......"
<0059> \{[Takami]}
<0060> "...What's wrong? You have a strange look on your face.
<0061> \ Did something happen while I was away?
<0062> \{［伶］}
<0063> "......"
<0064> \{[Takami]}
<0065> "Hey - what's wrong, Rei?"
<0066> \{［伶］}
<0067> "...I...I'll pretend you're not here..."
<0068> \{[Takami]}
<0069> "Huh? What are you talking about?"
<0070> \{［伶］}
<0071> "When I woke up, you were gone,
<0072> \ I thought you had gone away while I was sleeping,
<0073> \ I was completely convinced..."
<0074> \{[Takami]}
<0075> "Huh?! What's that?
<0076> \ Did you not trust a word I said at all?
<0077> \{［伶］}
<0078> "...Even if you say so,
<0079> \ Since you weren't in the room, I assumed..."
<0080> \{[Takami]}
<0081> "...Did I make you feel uneasy?
<0082> \ Sorry for leaving you alone when you woke up.
<0083> \{［伶］}
<0084> "! No, don't apologize. It's not your fault.
<0085> \ This is just like being a child.
<0086> \ I'm not at an age where I'm afraid of sleeping alone, so..."
<0087> \{［伶］}
<0088> "......"
<0089> \{[Takami]}
<0090> "...Rei. Your cheeks are red, you see?"
<0091> \{［伶］}
<0092> "...You're a bit noisy."
<0093> \{[Takami]}
<0094> "Haha, our positions are reversed!
<0095> \ To see you blush at my words,
<0096> \ Perhaps this is your first time?
<0097> \{［伶］}
<0098> "......"
<0099> \{[Takami]}
<0100> "...I will never leave your side.
<0101> \ I will declare this first.
<0102> \ It's too late now for you to say you don't want to.
<0103> \{[Takami]}
<0104> "Even if you cry and beg me to leave you, it's too late.
<0105> \ I won't leave your side."
<0106> \{［伶］}
<0107> "Takami..."
<0108> \{[Takami]}
<0109> "Look, here's the coffee I brought over while it was still hot.
<0110> \ Drink it before it gets cold."
<0111> \{［伶］}
<0112> "...That's right. I'll take it."
<0113> The mug he offered me as if to hide his embarrassment,
<0114> I took it from Takami with both hands,
<0115> Rei holds the warmth in the palm of her hand.
<0116> The heat warms not only your fingertips but also your heart.
<0117> Feeling a sense of calm and peace, Rei smiled.
<0118> \{［伶］}
<0119> "...Takami?"
<0120> As soon as I opened my eyes,
<0121> I saw Takami sleeping with his eyes closed in comfort,
<0122> Rei's eyes widened in shock.
<0123> \{［伶］}
<0124> (Ahh, I see. While I was talking with Takami,
<0125> \ Just sleep like that...)
<0126> Last night, we sat side by side on the bed,
<0127> As we talked late into the night,
<0128> Before she knew it, Rei had accidentally fallen asleep.
<0129> The one who put the blanket over Rei's body was,
<0130> It seemed like Takami,
<0131> After pulling up the coverlet, Takami seems to have run out of strength.
<0132> He is asleep, curled up next to Rei.
<0133> \{［伶］}
<0134> (...Somehow, a big, friendly dog,
<0135> \ It's like he's sleeping next to me.)
<0136> Gently reach out your hand,
<0137> Takami's hair was softly breathing as he slept.
<0138> Touch it as if you were stroking the head of a large dog.
<0139> It was much softer than I expected and felt very comfortable.
<0140> Stay like that for a while,
<0141> I tangle my fingers in Takami's hair and play with it.
<0142> She had no fear of Rei's power, which even her mother feared,
<0143> He declared that he would always be by Rei's side,
<0144> I never thought that someone would actually do that.
<0145> It's like something you'd only show to someone you trust.
<0146> While gazing at Takami's defenseless sleeping face,
<0147> Rei was in a calm mood and played with her disheveled hair.
<0148> Eventually, she let out a small "hmm" sound,
<0149> Takami woke up to a presence.
<0150> I looked at Rei with my sleepy eyes wide open.
<0151> \{[Takami]}
<0152> "...Hmm, what's going on? You're already awake, Rei..."
<0153> \{［伶］}
<0154> "Good morning, Takami. You still look sleepy.
<0155> \ It seems you went to bed later,
<0156> \ I don't mind sleeping a little longer."
<0157> \{[Takami]}
<0158> "...Is that so? Then..."
<0159> Even as he muttered, his eyelids suddenly dropped.
<0160> In an instant, Takami returns to the land of sleep.
<0161> As I put the blanket back on Takami's shoulders,
<0162> When the person you opened your heart to wakes up, they're still sleeping next to you.
<0163> Even in such a small event,
<0164> For the first time, Rei realized what it felt like to have her heart warmed.
<0165> In the end, Takami stayed behind at the mansion that day.
<0166> He never left Rei's side,
<0167> The two of them ended up spending the whole day together.
<0168> Takami follows me around without leaving my side for even a moment.
<0169> Gradually, Rei began to follow her master around happily, wagging her tail.
<0170> It makes me feel like I'm dragging a large dog around.
<0171> \{［伶］}
<0172> "...Takami, do you not have to go to work?"
<0173> \{[Takami]}
<0174> "I contacted them this morning and gave them instructions.
<0175> \ I've decided to take an emergency leave today.
<0176> \{［伶］}
<0177> "...Takami, can you please leave now?
<0178> \ Annoying."
<0179> \{[Takami]}
<0180> "Hey, Rei! You don't have to say such cold things...!"
<0181> \{［伶］}
<0182> "...It's heavy, Takami."
<0183> \{[Takami]}
<0184> "It's because you say such cruel things!"
<0185> \{［伶］}
<0186> "Wait... it's really heavy,
<0187> \ Wait, Takami...!
<0188> \{[Takami]}
<0189> "No. I won't wait."
<0190> \{［伶］}
<0191> "Takami...!"
<0192> He plays around like a child, hitting Takami on the head,
<0193> As she chases them away, Rei lets out a sigh.
<0194> \{［伶］}
<0195> "You've always been a bit childish,
<0196> \ I'm acting like a kid today.
<0197> \ Don't mess with me with such a big \ruby{shape}={form}."
<0198> \{[Takami]}
<0199> "I can't stand in front of you anymore.
<0200> \ I stopped forcing myself to be strong and putting on a false front."
<0201> \{[Takami]}
<0202> "And there's something I've been thinking about for a while.
<0203> \ I decided to do that today."
<0204> \{[Takami]}
<0205> "Once I made up my mind... I felt relieved."
<0206> \{［伶］}
<0207> "...What exactly have you decided?"
<0208> \{[Takami]}
<0209> "I don't want to continue doing shady work anymore.
<0210> \ Therefore, from now on, the Kujo family will withdraw from all shady business dealings.
<0211> \{［伶］}
<0212> "Eh...!"
<0213> \{[Takami]}
<0214> "It's not a business that I wanted to take over.
<0215> \ I cut off all ties with business that I don't like,
<0216> \ I would like to take this opportunity to give the Kujo family a new lease on life.
<0217> \{［伶］}
<0218> "I will give the Kujo family a new lease on life..."
<0219> \{[Takami]}
<0220> "There are quite a few people involved in Article 9's work.
<0221> \ I have a responsibility to them, and if I were the only one to quit, they would run away,
<0222> \ We can't just throw everything away irresponsibly."
<0223> \{[Takami]}
<0224> "It is true that the background to the growth of the Kujo family is
<0225> \ It is largely due to the underground business of dealing in "products."
<0226> \ But the Kujo family has already gained enough power."
<0227> \{[Takami]}
<0228> "Now,
<0229> \ The Kujo family does not really need the power of their customers.
<0230> \ In fact, it could become an obstacle in the future.
<0231> \{［伶］}
<0232> "Takami..."
<0233> \{[Takami]}
<0234> "Some people are difficult to break up with,
<0235> \ I'm confident I can handle it well, so don't worry."
<0236> \{[Takami]}
<0237> "It's times like these that I'm grateful for my father's education."
<0238> \{[Takami]}
<0239> "Well, if you think about it, all the seeds of trouble,
<0240> \ This is what my father left behind.
<0241> I'm the one being forced to clean up my father's mess."
<0242> \{[Takami]}
<0243> "If you think about it like that, there's no need to be grateful to him."
<0244> \{［伶］}
<0245> "Yes... if that's what you've decided,
<0246> \ That might be a good idea."
<0247> \{[Takami]}
<0248> "Now, you and I can finally truly...
<0249> \ I guess I'll be freed from my father's curse."
<0250> \{［伶］}
<0251> "Yeah... I guess so."
<0252> \{[Takami]}
<0253> "...Umm, so...
<0254> \ Regarding the future,
<0255> \ There's something I'd like to discuss with you..."
<0256> \{［伶］}
<0257> "What about the future? I wonder what it's about?"
<0258> \{[Takami]}
<0259> "...Um...As long as you don't mind,
<0260> \ I wonder if there's...
<0261> \{［伶］}
<0262> "...? I can't hear you very well.
<0263> \ Could you please speak a little more clearly?
<0264> \{[Takami]}
<0265> "...So, if you don't mind,
<0266> \ With me... I thought..."
<0267> \{［伶］}
<0268> "--Takami. Even if you say it in such a small voice,
<0269> \ I can't hear anything.
<0270> \ Just say it clearly and without any pretense.
<0271> \{[Takami]}
<0272> "--That's why!
<0273> \ Well, as long as you don't mind, that is!
<0274> \{［伶］}
<0275> "...Unless you don't mind?"
<0276> \{[Takami]}
<0277> "...Would you like to live with me...?"
<0278> \{［伶］}
<0279> "Eh...?"
<0280> \{[Takami]}
<0281> "Customers who are closely related to the Kujo family,
<0282> \ To completely cut ties,
<0283> \ I think I'll move Kujo's residence to another piece of land and start over."
<0284> \{[Takami]}
<0285> "If that happens, we'll be separated again.
<0286> \ So, on this occasion when I leave the mansion,
<0287> \ I was thinking, why not live together..."
<0288> \{［伶］}
<0289> "Takami..."
<0290> \{[Takami]}
<0291> "--No! I mean, if you don't want to,
<0292> \ I have no intention of forcing you!
<0293> \{[Takami]}
<0294> "Even if we continue to live separately,
<0295> \ Of course, we won't become estranged like we have been until now.
<0296> \ I have no intention of cutting ties with you!
<0297> \{[Takami]}
<0298> "So... if you don't mind, please think about it.
<0299> \ To live with me..."
<0300> \{［伶］}
<0301> "...Hey, Takami. Those words of yours...
<0302> \ Can I take this as a proposal to me?"
<0303> \{[Takami]}
<0304> "A-Are you proposing to me?!"
<0305> \{［伶］}
<0306> "Isn't that right?
<0307> \ I don't want to be separated so I thought we should live together.
<0308> \ Or... is it different?
<0309> \{[Takami]}
<0310> "No - certainly, that's what it comes down to... I guess.
<0311> \ Yeah, you can take it that way.
<0312> \{[Takami]}
<0313> "So... Rei, I want you to think about it seriously.
<0314> \ These words of mine――」
<0315> \{［伶］}
<0316> "...I understand. I'll try to think positively.
<0317> \ It might not be so bad to live with you again like back then."
<0318> \{[Takami]}
<0319> “Rei…!”
<0320> Takami, overjoyed, took both of Rei's hands,
<0321> The moment I held that hand tightly in my palm,
<0322> Suddenly, the door slid open with a loud noise.
<0323> \{[Takami]}
<0324> "Wha... Who is that?!"
<0325> \{[Mari]}
<0326> "Congratulations, Rei-sama...!!
<0327> \ I hope you'll be happy...!
<0328> \{［伶］}
<0329> "Mari...?"
<0330> \{[Takami]}
<0331> "Wait, wait a minute!
<0332> \ What are you?! What on earth are you――!?」
<0333> \{[Takami]}
<0334> "Mari! Have you been listening all this time?!"
<0335> \{[Mari]}
<0336> "Yes! I brought some tea and snacks.
<0337> \ I was in the middle of a serious consultation,
<0338> \ We talked outside for a while."
<0339> \{[Mari]}
<0340> "But Rei-sama looks so happy,
<0341> \ I just couldn't sit still!
<0342> \{[Mari]}
<0343> "Rei-sama, congratulations...!"
<0344> \{［伶］}
<0345> "Mari, by the way, are you in this room?
<0346> \ I thought you were here to bring tea?
<0347> \{[Mari]}
<0348> "That's right! I've brought tea for you two!
<0349> \ I'll have it ready right away..."
<0350> \{[Mari]}
<0351> "...Oh? The tea has gotten really cold."
<0352> \{[Takami]}
<0353> "Don't eavesdrop until it gets to that point!"
<0354> \{［伶］}
<0355> "...Mari..."
<0356> \{[Mari]}
<0357> "I will now prepare a meal for you two.
<0358> \ Since it's such a special day,
<0359> \ Tonight I'll show off my cooking skills and prepare a feast...!
<0360> \{［伶］}
<0361> "No... I don't mind a normal meal."
<0362> \{[Mari]}
<0363> "Well, at a time like this, we need a celebratory cake...!"
<0364> \{[Takami]}
<0365> "That's enough!!"
<0366> \{[Mari]}
<0367> "I see...that's unfortunate..."
<0368> \{［伶］}
<0369> "Mariie, I appreciate your feelings.
<0370> \ Please make the special cake next time.
<0371> \ I want you to decorate it as lavishly as possible - for Takami's sake."
<0372> \{[Takami]}
<0373> "What? Me?!"
<0374> \{[Mari]}
<0375> "Yes! Well then, I'll be off now.
<0376> \ Until your meal is ready,
<0377> \ Please make yourself comfortable by yourself.
<0378> \{[Takami]}
<0379> "...He's gone. Seriously, what's up with him?
<0380> \ I know you don't mean any harm, but it just doesn't seem right.
<0381> \{[Takami]}
<0382> "Um, so, regarding the upcoming discussion,
<0383> \ Continuing on..."
<0384> \{[Takami]}
<0385> "As of tonight, I will cut ties with any business I cannot be proud of.
<0386> \ Starting tomorrow, this mansion will no longer be of any use.
<0387> \ Once we free Nozomi from here, we'll leave the mansion.
<0388> \{[Takami]}
<0389> "There's no time to catch your breath until everything is finished,
<0390> \ Once you've calmed down, stretch your wings in a quiet place,
<0391> \ I'll think carefully about what to do after that."
<0392> \{[Takami]}
<0393> "If only you were by my side at that time,
<0394> \ I think you'll be happy..."
<0395> \{［伶］}
<0396> "That's right... about that too,
<0397> \ Try to think positively.
<0398> \{[Takami]}
<0399> "Really? I'm hoping for a good answer!"
<0400> The moment Takami broke into a happy smile,
<0401> Again, a knock came, dampening the mood.
<0402> \{[Mari]}
<0403> "Ummm... Takami-sama, while we were talking,
<0404> \ I'm sorry again and again..."
<0405> \{[Takami]}
<0406> "...So, what's next?"
<0407> Takami was overjoyed and took both of Rei's hands,
<0408> I clenched his hand tightly in my palm.
<0409> \{[Takami]}
<0410> "As of tonight, I am cutting ties with any business I cannot be proud of.
<0411> \ Starting tomorrow, this mansion will no longer be of any use.
<0412> \ Once we free Nozomi from here, we'll leave the mansion.
<0413> \{[Takami]}
<0414> "There's no time to catch your breath until everything is finished,
<0415> \ Once you've calmed down, stretch your wings in a quiet place,
<0416> \ I'll think carefully about what to do after that."
<0417> \{[Takami]}
<0418> "If only you were by my side at that time,
<0419> \ I think you'll be happy..."
<0420> \{［伶］}
<0421> "That's right... about that too,
<0422> \ Try to think positively.
<0423> \{[Takami]}
<0424> "Really? I'm hoping for a good answer!"
<0425> The moment Takami broke into a happy smile,
<0426> A depressing knock came on the door.
<0427> \{[Mari]}
<0428> "Ummm... Takami-sama, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
<0429> \ Can I have a moment...?
<0430> \{[Takami]}
<0431> "What do you want from me?"
<0432> \{[Mari]}
<0433> "We have received an urgent call.
<0434> \ You introduced yourself as Katagiri-sama, what should I do?
<0435> \{[Takami]}
<0436> "Katagiri called me? I wonder what happened.
<0437> \ --Okay. Please connect the line to me.
<0438> \{[Mari]}
<0439> "Yes. I will put you through to the next person.
<0440> \ Please wait a moment.
<0441> There was no telephone in Rei's room,
<0442> Marie seems to have hurried back to get it.
<0443> The sound of light, pattering footsteps scurrying away fades into the distance.
<0444> The person on the phone and the name Marie had just given me,
<0445> That sounds familiar.
<0446> Rei spoke the name as if ruminating.
<0447> \{［伶］}
<0448> "Katagiri--?"
<0449> \{[Takami]}
<0450> "Yeah... Katagiri is my subordinate.
<0451> \ That being said, he was actually my father's subordinate."
<0452> \{[Takami]}
<0453> "You must know about Katagiri.
<0454> \ We've met a few times at Kujo's residence, right?
<0455> \ I was introduced as my father's secretary--"
<0456> \{［伶］}
<0457> "Ahーthat person, you mean?"
<0458> \{［伶］}
<0459> "I've never spoken to him personally,
<0460> \ I remember meeting such a person at the residence.
<0461> \ ...It was rare for me to meet someone I work with."
<0462> \{[Takami]}
<0463> "Now that I think about it, my father told people at work,
<0464> \ I tried my best not to let you meet.
<0465> \ Was Katagiri the only one who gave a proper introduction?
<0466> \{[Takami]}
<0467> "Katagiri is a trusted subordinate of my father,
<0468> \ He is a man who has served the Kujo family for many years.
<0469> \ After my father passed away, he continued to serve me.
<0470> \{［伶］}
<0471> "...with eyes that are somehow unreliable,
<0472> \ I didn't have a very good impression of him."
<0473> \{[Takami]}
<0474> "Well, maybe that's true. After all, behind the Kujo family's shop, which handles goods,
<0475> \ Because he is the person who has been in charge of everything.
<0476> \ He's not easy to deal with, he's quite strong."
<0477> \{[Takami]}
<0478> "But Katagiri has earned his father's trust,
<0479> \ Negotiations with customers and management of products,
<0480> \ He has held an important position in the Kujo family--"
<0481> \{[Takami]}
<0482> "So you can trust me."
<0483> \{［伶］}
<0484> "...I see. If you say so,
<0485> \ I guess there's nothing to worry about.
<0486> \ Maybe I'm worrying a little too much."
<0487> However, Takami declared that he would close his underground business.
<0488> Right after that――
<0489> From someone who is in charge of dealing with the customer,
<0490> It's a horrible feeling to get a phone call.
<0491> Takami receives the phone that Marie brought,
<0492> I spoke to his senior subordinate through the receiver.
<0493> \{[Takami]}
<0494> "Oh, it's Katagiri. What on earth are you doing here at this time of night?
<0495> \ Have you had any trouble at work?
<0496> \{[Takami]}
<0497> "--Huh? Rei's there too?"
<0498> \{[Takami]}
<0499> "Yes, as you say, Rei is also staying at the mansion,
<0500> \ What does that have to do with you--"
<0501> \{[Takami]}
<0502> "Huh?! You want to talk to Rei too?
<0503> \ What do you mean, this story is related to Rei too?
<0504> \{[Takami]}
<0505> "Hey... Katagiri?!"
<0506> \{［伶］}
<0507> "Takami, it seems like people are talking about me.
<0508> \ What on earth happened?"
<0509> \{[Takami]}
<0510> "Katagiri specifically mentioned that he wanted to talk to you."
<0511> \{[Takami]}
<0512> "--Katagiri. I hope your voice reaches Rei,
<0513> \ Switch this audio mode to external speaker"
<0514> Takami flipped the audio switch on the phone,
<0515> After a brief silence,
<0516> A deep male voice came over the loudspeaker.
<0517> \{[Katagiri]}
<0518> “…It’s been a long time, Rei-sama.
<0519> \ It's a shame I can't meet you in person.
<0520> \ Do you remember me?
<0521> \{［伶］}
<0522> "I remember you,
<0523> \ I wasn't on friendly terms with you.
<0524> \{［伶］}
<0525> "Soーwhat did you tell me?"
<0526> \{[Katagiri]}
<0527> "This is a bit of an old story -- about 20 years ago,
<0528> \ While I serve Lord Takahisa,
<0529> \ I have decided to personally get involved in a certain research project.
<0530> \{[Katagiri]}
<0531> "The research is still ongoing,
<0532> \ This is a difficult problem, and it has taken twenty years since we started.
<0533> \ I can't get the results I want...'
<0534> \{［伶］}
<0535> "...What does that have to do with me?"
<0536> \{[Katagiri]}
<0537> “What does this story have to do with you?
<0538> \ Yes, there is, a great deal of it...!
<0539> \ Really, really――』
<0540> \{[Katagiri]}
<0541> "The truth is... the subject I chose for my research is,
<0542> \ It was the same as Takahisa-sama's.
<0543> \{[Takami]}
<0544> "With my father...?"
<0545> \{[Takami]}
<0546> "--! You, don't tell me...!?"
<0547> \{[Katagiri]}
<0548> "Yes, the subject of my research is, in other words, Angels."
<0549> \{［伶］}
<0550> "--!"
<0551> \{[Takami]}
<0552> "You... knew that name too...!"
<0553> \{[Katagiri]}
<0554> “…I’d rather
<0555> \ I know a great deal about Angels.
<0556> \ Yes, for over twenty yearsー
<0557> \{[Katagiri]}
<0558> "In the meantime, as Takahisa-sama's faithful confidant,
<0559> I also lent my support in many ways...
<0560> \{[Katagiri]}
<0561> “So, about Rei-sama’s Angel,
<0562> \ I am well aware of this.
<0563> \{[Takami]}
<0564> "So... you,
<0565> \ So you were a collaborator in my father's experiments?"
<0566> \{[Katagiri]}
<0567> "Yes, at first... that was the case."
<0568> \{[Katagiri]}
<0569> “However, I personally,
<0570> \ I'm researching angels with different methods and purposes than Takahisa-sama.
<0571> \ The transfer has been completed.
<0572> \{[Takami]}
<0573> "You're studying Angels differently from your father... privately?"
<0574> \{[Katagiri]}
<0575> "The reason I started researching angels was
<0576> \ It's you - Rei-sama.
<0577> \{［伶］}
<0578> "I...was it the trigger?"
<0579> \{[Katagiri]}
<0580> "Rei-sama, we would like to
<0581> \ I would like to ask for your cooperation as an angel.
<0582> \{［伶］}
<0583> "...cooperation means, to me,
<0584> \ Am I to be a guinea pig for your experiments?"
<0585> \{[Katagiri]}
<0586> "Guinea pigs, that's impossible..."
<0587> \{[Katagiri]}
<0588> “You are a very valuable individual.
<0589> \ As our distinguished guest,
<0590> \ We will do our best to treat you with the utmost respect.
<0591> \{［伶］}
<0592> "No matter how you try to explain it, I'm not
<0593> \ It remains the same that they will be treated as research subjects.
<0594> \{[Takami]}
<0595> "I will never forgive you for something like that...!
<0596> \ I won't hand over Rei to the likes of you!
<0597> \{[Katagiri]}
<0598> “…Then, for Rei-sama,
<0599> \ We will be asking for your cooperation even if it is difficult.
<0600> \{[Takami]}
<0601> "I won't let you lay a hand on Rei...!"
<0602> \{[Katagiri]}
<0603> "Oh, Takami-sama, are you trying to get in my way?
<0604> \ If that's the case, we won't show any mercy.
<0605> \{[Katagiri]}
<0606> "Even if it means using force, Rei-sama,
<0607> \ We will bring you to us--'
<0608> \{[Takami]}
<0609> "Katagiri...!"
<0610> \{[Takami]}
<0611> "You have betrayed my trust...!"
<0612> \{[Katagiri]}
<0613> “Haha… You’re so sweet, Takami-san.
<0614> \ Unlike your father, he is not used to being suspicious of others..."
<0615> \{[Katagiri]}
<0616> “Your father was always vigilant,
<0617> \ He is cunning, bold, and merciless,
<0618> \ He was a frightening person to have as an enemy...'
<0619> \{[Katagiri]}
<0620> “But, Takami-sama, you are different from your father.
<0621> \ He's very...kind-hearted.
<0622> \{[Katagiri]}
<0623> “I have served your father faithfully until now,
<0624> \ You have always valued me without question...'
<0625> \{[Katagiri]}
<0626> “I don’t have the courage to confront Takahisa-sama face to face,
<0627> \ You were an easy target.
<0628> \{[Katagiri]}
<0629> “You used me really well, didn’t you…”
<0630> \{[Takami]}
<0631> "Ugh...!"
<0632> \{[Katagiri]}
<0633> "Takami-sama, everything else will be decided by
<0634> \ Leave it to me.
<0635> \ I know the value of an Angel better than you do.
<0636> \{[Takami]}
<0637> "You...!
<0638> How dare you act so brazenly...!
<0639> \{[Katagiri]}
<0640> "Unfortunately, you can't escape from the mansion now.
<0641> \ We have completely surrounded them...'
<0642> *kukukuku*... a venomous, chuckling voice came.
<0643> Delivers from the other end of the phone.
<0644> \{[Katagiri]}
<0645> "Rei-sama, I hope you will find a suitable welcome.
<0646> \ I've brought him to the mansion.
<0647> \ I have been wanting to meet you for a long time.
<0648> \{[Katagiri]}
<0649> "That person took you and the boy,
<0650> \ We will show you to our laboratory.
<0651> \{[Katagiri]}
<0652> “I don’t want to be rough with you,
<0653> \ Please accompany me quietly.
<0654> But... if push comes to shove, I'll use any means necessary.
<0655> \{[Takami]}
<0656> "How can I follow such words--!"
<0657> \{[Katagiri]}
<0658> "What I want is the angel Rei-sama,
<0659> \ There are only two boys who share the same Angel bloodline.
<0660> \ Takami-sama... you are not needed.
<0661> \{[Katagiri]}
<0662> 『If you are going to get in the way,
<0663> \ I will not hesitate to eliminate you.'
<0664> \{[Katagiri]}
<0665> "Please, prepare yourself for that."
<0666> \{[Takami]}
<0667> "Katagiri...!"
<0668> As if mocking Takami's anger,
<0669> The call was abruptly ended.
<0670> \{[Takami]}
<0671> "Damn... that guy!"
<0672> \{［伶］}
<0673> "Mariie, please take care of Nozomi. I can't leave Nozomi alone.
<0674> \ I want you to bring him here right away."
<0675> \{[Mari]}
<0676> "Okay! I'll bring Nozomi over here."
<0677> Marie goes to pick up Nozomi,
<0678> He hurriedly ran out of the room.
<0679> \{［伶］}
<0680> "...Katagiri said they were surrounding the mansion."
<0681> \{［伶］}
<0682> "The main exit from the mansion is likely covered.
<0683> \ We must find another way out..."
<0684> \{［伶］}
<0685> "At an exit that would be difficult for an outsider to notice,
<0686> \ Do you have any idea?
<0687> \{[Takami]}
<0688> "...the layout of the mansion and the security measures,
<0689> I have that basic information as well."
<0690> \{[Takami]}
<0691> "It'll be difficult to find an exit without Katagiri finding out..."
<0692> Taking advantage of the short time I had while waiting for Marie,
<0693> At that moment, Takami and I were discussing the escape route from the mansion.
<0694> Suddenly, all the lights in the building went out.
<0695> \{[Takami]}
<0696> "Damn, the light's gone...!?"
<0697> Without warning, I was suddenly thrown into the pitch black world of night,
<0698> Only Takami's voice echoed in the darkness.
<0699> \{［伶］}
<0700> "...It seems the power has been turned off."
<0701> \{[Takami]}
<0702> "Ah... it seems that's the case.
<0703> \ If this is Katagiri's doing,
<0704> \ The backup power supply must also be disabled.
<0705> \{[Takami]}
<0706> "Damn, now the security system is...
<0707> \ It stopped working completely.
<0708> \ This means that we have lost the means to prevent intrusion from outside.
<0709> \{[Takami]}
<0710> "Hey, somebodyーcall security!"
<0711> Takami shouted out to the outside of the room,
<0712> The voice echoed hollowly in the hall, as quiet as a pond.
<0713> \{［伶］}
<0714> "...Don't you notice, Takami?
<0715> \ The mansion is too quiet."
<0716> \{[Takami]}
<0717> "Now that you mention it... it's certainly too quiet..."
<0718> \{［伶］}
<0719> "Even after all this time, the people at the mansion who don't know the circumstances,
<0720> \ It's strange not to make a fuss."
<0721> All the lights are out and still not restored,
<0722> The building was unnaturally quiet.
<0723> --I have a bad feeling about this.
<0724> It feels as though something is quietly progressing in this darkness.
<0725> I feel extremely unsafe.
<0726> I'll just wait in the room
<0727> I'll go look for it.
<0728> I waited in my room for Marie to come home for a while,
<0729> There is no sign of Marie returning.
<0730> \{[Takami]}
<0731> "...You're late, Marie.
<0732> \ Could it be that something happened along the way...?
<0733> \{[Takami]}
<0734> "Damn, I can't wait any longer!
<0735> \ Let's go and check it out!
<0736> Before anyone could stop him, Takami opened the door to the room.
<0737> The hallway was plunged into pitch black darkness, with not even a streetlight lit.
<0738> Beyond the door lies a vast expanse.
<0739> \{[Takami]}
<0740> "...No one seems to be coming..."
<0741> Rei looked around the silent corridor on both sides,
<0742> Still no one in sight.
<0743> And then――at that moment.
<0744> \{［伶］}
<0745> "…………!?"
<0746> Suddenly, Rei sensed the presence of something other than themselves.
<0747> I sense it in the darkness behind me.
<0748> \{［伶］}
<0749> (Someone other than us is here!)
<0750> A chill runs down my spine,
<0751> I started to turn around in the direction I felt the presenceー
<0752> A quick, silent arm stretched out from behind me.
<0753> Rei's movements were controlled.
<0754> \{［伶］}
<0755> "――!!"
<0756> A cloth soaked in some kind of chemical was tightly pressed against my mouth,
<0757> Unable to resist, she is forced to drink the drug.
<0758> The strong smell of chemicals made me dizzy,
<0759> All the strength in my body went away,
<0760> My consciousness sinks unstoppably into darkness.
<0761> Unable to endure, my body collapsed to the floor from my feet,
<0762> Someone's arms catch it.
<0763> \{［伶］}
<0764> “…Who…?”
<0765> However, as my vision rapidly sank into darkness,
<0766> I can't see his face.
<0767> Rei heard a familiar sound in her ears.
<0768> He says with a wry smile.
<0769> \{[? ]}
<0770> "Rei - I've come to take you."
<0771> \{［伶］}
<0772> "...Who...are you...?"
<0773> \{[? ]}
<0774> "I'm here to take you."
<0775> \{［伶］}
<0776> "...! Katagiri was talking about, are you here to pick me up...?"
<0777> \{［伶］}
<0778> "Takami... Huh...?"
<0779> \{［伶］}
<0780> "If you're targeting me... then don't lay a hand on Takami...!"
<0781> \{[? ]}
<0782> "Well, you see -- what should we do?"
<0783> \{［伶］}
<0784> "...!"
<0785> \{[? ]}
<0786> "Come on, Rei. Just go to bed well for tonight.
<0787> \ The next time you wake up, you'll be--"
<0788> As my consciousness fades, I sense a ripple of laughter.
<0789> It echoes in Rei's ears forever.
<0790> And soon,
<0791> Rei's consciousness sank into the depths of darkness.
<0792> \{［伶］}
<0793> "...Takami, let's leave the room."
<0794> \{[Takami]}
<0795> "That's fine, but
<0796> \ What on earth are you planning to do...?
<0797> \{［伶］}
<0798> "I'm worried about Marie and the others. Let's go find them and meet up."
<0799> It was a dark night, with the new moon fast approaching.
<0800> When the lights in the building, even the night lights illuminating the hallways, were turned off,
<0801> The area is enveloped in deep darkness, blending into the surrounding forest.
<0802> I strained my eyes, relying on the faint moonlight,
<0803> My eyes finally got used to the dim light that enveloped my body,
<0804> Although unsteady, he is able to walk without fumbling around.
<0805> \{[Takami]}
<0806> "Anyway, where are we heading?
<0807> \ If we're looking for Marie and the others, we should head to Nozomi's room..."
<0808> \{［伶］}
<0809> "That's right... let's head there first."
<0810> \{［伶］}
<0811> "However, along the way,
<0812> \ It would be best to check for possible escape routes.
<0813> \{［伶］}
<0814> "Once I meet up with Marie,
<0815> \ Let's get out of there right away."
<0816> \{[Takami]}
<0817> "In that case, should we use the window to escape?"
<0818> \{[Takami]}
<0819> "Now that the power is off and security is disabled,
<0820> \ The windows shouldn't be locked either."
<0821> \{［伶］}
<0822> "Well, let's check first."
<0823> Open the nearest door along the corridor.
<0824> Takami immediately rushes to the large window facing the garden.
<0825> \{[Takami]}
<0826> "...It's no good, it won't open!?"
<0827> Rei also lent her strength, and the two of them tried many times,
<0828> The window won't open.
<0829> \{[Takami]}
<0830> "Damn... is the system still alive?!"
<0831> \{[Takami]}
<0832> "...to escape from here,
<0833> \ What is the security situation inside the building?
<0834> \ Perhaps I should check..."
<0835> \{[Takami]}
<0836> "On the way to Nozomi's room,
<0837> \ I'd like to take a look at the security system control room,
<0838> \ Is that okay?
<0839> \{［伶］}
<0840> "That's right - there are other things too,
<0841> \ While checking for any possible exits,
<0842> \ Let's head to Marie and the others."
<0843> First, I started walking towards the security system control room,
<0844> The entire mansion was eerily quiet,
<0845> There is not the slightest sign of life.
<0846> \{［伶］}
<0847> "It's so quiet... I can't help but think there's no one here."
<0848> \{[Takami]}
<0849> "...In this mansion, including the guards,
<0850> \ There are more than ten people working there.
<0851> \{[Takami]}
<0852> "Even if Katagiri's collaborators are among them,
<0853> \ It's hard to imagine that everyone was like that.
<0854> \{[Takami]}
<0855> "Soーwithout any fuss,
<0856> \ People disappearing from the building,
<0857> \ This is an unthinkable situation..."
<0858> However, if there are more than a dozen people left in the mansion,
<0859> The voices and sounds that should surely be heard,
<0860> No matter how carefully I listen, I can't hear anything.
<0861> I looked into each room I passed,
<0862> The people have disappeared, leaving behind an unnatural silence.
<0863> Takami had a clue about the place that could be the exit.
<0864> We searched everywhere,
<0865> As far as I can think of, I can't find any viable escape route.
<0866> \{［伶］}
<0867> "Everywhere seems to be sealed off, and we can't get out."
<0868> I tiptoed through the deserted corridor,
<0869> Soon we reach the security systems control room.
<0870> \{[Takami]}
<0871> "In the control room, there are various monitors installed in the mansion.
<0872> \ There are always people taking turns monitoring it.
<0873> \{[Takami]}
<0874> "No matter what happens, this place will never be deserted.
<0875> \ It should be absolutely impossible--"
<0876> \{［伶］}
<0877> "--There's no one here."
<0878> \{[Takami]}
<0879> "That's strange... The security sensors...
<0880> \ They're all turned off!
<0881> \{[Takami]}
<0882> "However, some parts of the system are still alive,
<0883> \ All of our commands have been rendered ineffective..."
<0884> \{[Takami]}
<0885> "It's no good - I'm at my wit's end.
<0886> \ Unless you're an expert, it can't be deactivated.
<0887> \{［伶］}
<0888> "...The mansion's system is
<0889> \ Have they been taken over by the enemy?
<0890> \{[Takami]}
<0891> "Oh, that's it.
<0892> \ We are like birds in a cage..."
<0893> After Rei and Takami left the security system control room,
<0894> I headed to Nozomi's room.
<0895> \{［伶］}
<0896> "Nozomi, Marie... are you here?"
<0897> I looked into Nozomi's room to see what was inside,
<0898> The two of them are nowhere to be seen.
<0899> \{[Takami]}
<0900> "...It seems Marie is...
<0901> \ It seems we've missed each other.
<0902> \{［伶］}
<0903> "That's true..."
<0904> When I came out into the hallway again,
<0905> Suddenly, the sound of a phone ringing echoed through the darkness, breaking the silence.
<0906> \{［伶］}
<0907> "This is..."
<0908> \{[Takami]}
<0909> "...It must be Katagiri's doing."
<0910> After hesitating for a while, Takami decided to answer the phone.
<0911> Rei also leans her ear close to the receiver to try to hear the conversation.
<0912> \{[Katagiri]}
<0913> 『Even on an adventure around an abandoned mansion,
<0914> \ I thought you might be getting tired of it by now,
<0915> \ I've called you--'
<0916> \{[Takami]}
<0917> "Katagiri... you...!"
<0918> A mocking chuckle reached the ears,
<0919> Takami grinds his teeth in anger.
<0920> \{[Katagiri]}
<0921> 『If you are satisfied with your adventure,
<0922> \ Would you like to come to the entrance hall?
<0923> \{[Katagiri]}
<0924> "The one who welcomes Rei-sama,
<0925> \ He should be waiting for you there.
<0926> \{[Katagiri]}
<0927> 『I think it would be better if you came earlier...』
<0928> \{[Katagiri]}
<0929> “After all, the person who came to pick me up is very capable,
<0930> \ I have a bit of a playful side..."
<0931> \{[Katagiri]}
<0932> "I think I've kept you waiting too long,
<0933> \ They might have started hunting on their own.'
<0934> \{[Takami]}
<0935> "Hey... what does that mean?"
<0936> \{[Katagiri]}
<0937> "Please hurry and come to the hall--"
<0938> After he told me this, the phone was hung up.
<0939> \{[Takami]}
<0940> "Damn it, are you trying to scare us into believing that?"
<0941> \{［伶］}
<0942> "...Those words didn't seem like a mere threat.
<0943> \ There was something ominous about it."
<0944> \{［伶］}
<0945> "Maybe the reason I can't see Marie and Nozomi is because
<0946> \ Already caught――?”
<0947> \{[Takami]}
<0948> "...There's no point in thinking about it like this.
<0949> \ Shall we head down the hall?
<0950> \{［伶］}
<0951> "That's right--"
<0952> When I reached the spacious entrance hall,
<0953> The thin, fragile moon is hidden by the clouds,
<0954> The moonlight that we had been relying on for a little while disappears.
<0955> Surrounded by a dense darkness that makes it hard to breathe,
<0956> I hesitate to even whisper.
<0957> \{［伶］}
<0958> (What――?)
<0959> In the depths of darkness, where you can't see even an inch ahead,
<0960> I sense something moving.
<0961> It has an ominous smell that makes your skin bubbling.
<0962> The presence doesn't seem to be human.
<0963> Rei wasn't the only one who noticed the ominous presence.
<0964> Takami, who was walking next to me,
<0965> You can sense the tension and breathlessness.
<0966> \{[Takami]}
<0967> "--Who is it? Is someone there?
<0968> \ If you are there, answer me!
<0969> \{[? ]}
<0970> "...I've been waiting.
<0971> \ For a long timeーfor a long time."
<0972> \{[? ]}
<0973> "We finally meet..."
<0974> A young man's voice came from the darkness.
<0975> Somewhere――a familiar, yet unfamiliar sound,
<0976> He says with a wry smile.
<0977> \{[? ]}
<0978> "I missed you... Rei"
<0979> \{［伶］}
<0980> "...!?"
<0981> My name was called by someone I shouldn't know,
<0982> Rei turns her gaze into the darkness with great caution.
<0983> \{[Takami]}
<0984> "Hey - who are you?
<0985> \ Don't hide, come out!
<0986> \{[? ]}
<0987> "I'm not hiding.
<0988> \ I've been waiting here for you to come.
<0989> \{[? ]}
<0990> "But... that's right. If I suddenly showed up,
<0991> \ I thought you'd be very surprised."
<0992> \{[? ]}
<0993> "That was a bit thoughtful..."
<0994> \{[Takami]}
<0995> "What does that mean?"
<0996> \{[? ]}
<0997> "This is what it means..."
<0998> The moon, like a cat's eyes, peeks out again from between the clouds,
<0999> Twilight slowly returns to the hall.
<1000> In response to Takami's question,
<1001> A dark shadow, like the darkness of the night, moves slowly.
<1002> Like a beast stalking its prey,
<1003> From the depths of the painted-on darkness,
<1004> Under the faint moonlight, something slowly appears...
<1005> What is that――?
<1006> \{［伶］}
<1007> "...!"
<1008> I saw a figure emerge from the pitch black darkness,
<1009> I could hear Takami gasping next to me.
<1010> Takami wasn't the only one to gasp in shock.
<1011> Because that person is-
<1012> \{[Takami]}
<1013> "Ah... that face...!"
<1014> \{[Takami]}
<1015> "Could it be... the same as Rei...?!"
<1016> Who is that?
<1017> Although she has the same face as Rei,
<1018> Not like Rei - the one with a faint smile.
<1019> Who is that?
<1020> \{[Takami]}
<1021> "Who are you...?! Who are you..."
<1022> \{[? ]}
<1023> "You are Kujo Takami, right?
<1024> \ The young head of the Kujo family who inherited the family after the death of the previous head, Kujo Takahisa..."
<1025> \{[Takami]}
<1026> "...!"
<1027> \{[? ]}
<1028> "And you, Saiga Rei--"
<1029> \{[? ]}
<1030> "Nice to meet you, Rei. I've always wanted to meet you."
<1031> \{［伶］}
<1032> "...I don't know you."
<1033> \{[? ]}
<1034> "I know you better than that."
<1035> \{[? ]}
<1036> "You are my precious half."
<1037> \{［伶］}
<1038> "Who are you?"
<1039> \{[? ]}
<1040> "--I don't have a name."
<1041> \{[? ]}
<1042> "There is only
<1043> \ They are just names given to me by people who fear me.
<1044> \{[Nue]}
<1045> "Yes... they call me '\ruby{Nue}={Nue}'"
<1046> \{［伶］}
<1047> "\ruby{Nue}={Nue}..."
<1048> This is what remains in ancient legends such as the Tale of the Heike.
<1049> The name of a strange, sinister monster.
<1050> The name is too sinister to be given to a person,
<1051> For some reason, it seemed very fitting for him.
<1052> \{[Takami]}
<1053> "Are you the one Katagiri sent to pick me up?"
<1054> \{[Nue]}
<1055> "Yes. I came to pick up Rei."
<1056> \{[Takami]}
<1057> "...I don't see anyone else,
<1058> \ Are you the only one who came to capture Rei?
<1059> \{[Nue]}
<1060> "Oh, it's just me.
<1061> \ I think I'm enough here by myself..."
<1062> \{[Takami]}
<1063> "You've really underestimated me...!"
<1064> \{[Nue]}
<1065> "I'm not taking it lightly. I think it's an objective judgment.
<1066> \ You guys are no match for me."
<1067> \{[Takami]}
<1068> "What...?"
<1069> The words, which hinted at an eerie sense of ease,
<1070> Rather than feeling anger, Rei senses an ominous smell.
<1071> \{［伶］}
<1072> "Where does that confidence come from?"
<1073> \{［伶］}
<1074> "Why did you go that far?
<1075> \ Do you have the confidence to face us alone?
<1076> \{[Nue]}
<1077> "Huh..."
<1078> \{[Nue]}
<1079> "There is no one else in this mansion but you,
<1080> \ --Have you noticed yet?
<1081> \{［伶］}
<1082> "...I noticed."
<1083> \{[Nue]}
<1084> "If I told you I did that all by myself,
<1085> \ Can you believe me?"
<1086> \{[Takami]}
<1087> "What--!?"
<1088> \{[Takami]}
<1089> "You mean, you're telling me that was all your doing?
<1090> \ How on earth..."
<1091> \{[Nue]}
<1092> "What? I turned it off."
<1093> \{[Takami]}
<1094> "Did you delete it...?"
<1095> \{[Nue]}
<1096> "Yes. With my own hands,
<1097> \ I erased it from this world without a trace.
<1098> \{[Nue]}
<1099> "That's my power."
<1100> \{［伶］}
<1101> "Your...power..."
<1102> As a collaborator in the experiment, he learns of the existence of the <Angel>.
<1103> With a different method and purpose than Takahisa,
<1104> Katagiri has been researching angels for the past 20 years.
<1105> He learns that Rei is a replica of the Angel,
<1106> He demanded custody of Rei, saying he needed her for his own research.
<1107> And then Katagiri sent,
<1108> A young man called Nue, who looks exactly like Rei.
<1109> He said that he had "eliminated" the people in the mansion with his own hands.
<1110> He calls this his "power."
<1111> \{［伶］}
<1112> "That's where your confidence comes from."
<1113> \{［伶］}
<1114> "The power of non-human entities"
<1115> \{[Takami]}
<1116> "You're not human...?!"
<1117> \{[Nue]}
<1118> "--As expected, you have good intuition.
<1119> \ I like intelligent people."
<1120> \{[Nue]}
<1121> "Ahhーor perhaps you, at the moment we met,
<1122> \ Perhaps you already sensed it?
<1123> \{[Nue]}
<1124> "Who am I..."
<1125> \{［伶］}
<1126> "......"
<1127> \{［伶］}
<1128> "You're just like me. --That's how I feel."
<1129> \{［伶］}
<1130> "You are... an angel."
<1131> \{[Takami]}
<1132> "Wh... What did you say?
<1133> \ This guy... is an Angel?!
<1134> \{[Nue]}
<1135> "Yes - I am an Angel.
<1136> \ The same as Rei... right?
<1137> \{[Takami]}
<1138> "He's the same as you... What does that mean, Rei?"
<1139> \{［伶］}
<1140> "......"
<1141> \{［伶］}
<1142> "Takami, can you think of a possibility like this?"
<1143> \{［伶］}
<1144> "The replica your father created from the blood of an Angel,
<1145> \ I was alone..."
<1146> \{［伶］}
<1147> "He only created me,
<1148> \ No further attempts were made to create copies of the Angel.
<1149> \{［伶］}
<1150> "But--"
<1151> \{［伶］}
<1152> "Someone other than that person is researching how to replicate Angels.
<1153> \ What if it continued after that...?
<1154> \{[Takami]}
<1155> "You mean...Katagiri, that was it?!"
<1156> \{[Takami]}
<1157> "--! So his true identity is...!"
<1158> \{[Nue]}
<1159> "That's right... I'm the same as Rei.
<1160> \ A replica of the Angel created under Katagiri
<1161> \{[Nue]}
<1162> "But let me correct you on one point.
<1163> \ You and I are not exactly the same.
<1164> \ There are some slight differences.
<1165> \{［伶］}
<1166> "What's different...?"
<1167> \{[Nue]}
<1168> "...Let me tell you an old story."
<1169> \{[Nue]}
<1170> "Once upon a time, in a certain place,
<1171> \ There was a man who was full of ambition..."
<1172> \{[Nue]}
<1173> "His name was Katagiri."
<1174> \{[Takami]}
<1175> "What...! Are you talking about him?"
<1176> \{[Nue]}
<1177> "Katagiri served Kujo Takahisa as a loyal subordinate,
<1178> In his heart, he felt jealousy towards Takahisa,
<1179> \ He was stained black with ambition to seize power.
<1180> \{[Nue]}
<1181> "He gives birth to the Angels on earth,
<1182> \ While cooperating with Takahisa's plan,
<1183> \ He was secretly looking for an opportunity to fulfil his own ambitions."
<1184> \{[Nue]}
<1185> "When I learned of the special powers that Angels possess,
<1186> \ He wondered if he could sell it as a military weapon.
<1187> \ That's what I thought..."
<1188> \{[Nue]}
<1189> "By just giving birth to one
<1190> \ Takahisa has stopped researching Angel clones,
<1191> \ He was dissatisfied, you seeー"
<1192> \{[Nue]}
<1193> "I secretly stole the blood of the Angel from Takahisa,
<1194> \ Research into cloning continued.
<1195> \{[Nue]}
<1196> "--But he soon runs into trouble."
<1197> \{[Nue]}
<1198> "When I made Rei, it went so well,
<1199> \ Even if you continue to try to create a perfect clone like Rei,
<1200> \ Failures continued.
<1201> \{[Nue]}
<1202> "Some have no intelligence, some cannot retain form,
<1203> \ Others are extremely fragile,
<1204> \ Some individuals died shortly after being born..."
<1205> \{[Nue]}
<1206> "However, the one trait that was common to all the clones was,
<1207> \ As it was ordained,
<1208> \ An extremely short lifespan, lasting only a few years--"
<1209> \{[Nue]}
<1210> "The Angel clones created by Katagiri,
<1211> \ The telomeres that determine the lifespan of living organisms are extremely short,
<1212> \ Every single one of them is born with a shorter lifespan than humans.
<1213> \{［伶］}
<1214> "...!"
<1215> \{[Takami]}
<1216> "Could it be that Rei is like that too?
<1217> \ So Rei was born with a shorter lifespan than most people...?!
<1218> \{[Nue]}
<1219> "After stealing it, the clone Katagiri created was...
<1220> \ I told you so.
<1221> \ Rei was the only one born without the fate of a short life.
<1222> \{［伶］}
<1223> "I'm the only one..."
<1224> \{[Nue]}
<1225> "...made by culturing the original adult somatic cells,
<1226> \ Do you know the weakness of somatic cell clones?
<1227> \{［伶］}
<1228> "...at the end of the chromosome,
<1229> \ The length of telomeres shortens with each cell division.
<1230> \ Somatic cell clones are influenced by adult cells.
<1231> \{［伶］}
<1232> "Dolly, the famous somatic cell cloned sheep,
<1233> \ From birth, telomeres are as short as those of a six-year-old adult,
<1234> \ Apparently he showed signs of aging at the age of one.
<1235> \{［伶］}
<1236> "So, somatic cell cloning is
<1237> \ Cells have already aged before we are born,
<1238> \ They can only live to the same age as adults..."
<1239> \{[Nue]}
<1240> "--That's right. To put it simply, somatic cell clones are,
<1241> \ They age and die sooner than naturally occurring individuals.
<1242> \{[Nue]}
<1243> "With modern cloning technology,
<1244> \ We have not yet found a way to solve this problem.
<1245> \{［伶］}
<1246> "...The reason why Angel clones have such a short lifespan is
<1247> \ Is that the reason?
<1248> \{[Nue]}
<1249> "Noーthat only applies to terrestrial creatures."
<1250> \{[Nue]}
<1251> "If we believe Takahisa's words, an angel is,
<1252> \ A being that is almost immortal,
<1253> \ Apparently it's even possible to choose your own lifespan."
<1254> \{[Nue]}
<1255> "Then, even if you are born as a somatic cell clone,
<1256> \ Unlike humans and other terrestrial creatures,
<1257> \ It was impossible for lifespans to be so short."
<1258> \{[Nue]}
<1259> "But for some reason, the newly created clone,
<1260> \ We are all born to a uniformly short life..."
<1261> \{[Nue]}
<1262> "It's as if they're declaring that no further blasphemy will be tolerated.
<1263> \ Like a curse cast by an Angel--"
<1264> \{［伶］}
<1265> "......"
<1266> \{［伶］}
<1267> "There's something that's been bothering me for a while now."
<1268> \{［伶］}
<1269> "Another Angel clone,
<1270> \ It is said that all people are destined to have short lives,
<1271> \ And what about you?
<1272> \{［伶］}
<1273> "If you're one of the clones,
<1274> \ Like the rest of us, we were born to a short life.
<1275> \{［伶］}
<1276> "But... seeing your age and appearance,
<1277> \ Those who have only a few years of life,
<1278> \ I don't think I can grow that much."
<1279> \{［伶］}
<1280> "What does that look like to you mean?"
<1281> \{[Nue]}
<1282> "...After continuing my research for a while, I realized why Takahisa
<1283> \ Why don't we go ahead and make a second or third clone?
<1284> \ Katagiri learned this firsthand.
<1285> \{[Nue]}
<1286> "I know that no one else will be able to successfully create a clone except you.
<1287> \ Takahisa probably knew from the beginning..."
<1288> \{[Nue]}
<1289> "Well, the mysterious blood of the Angel,
<1290> \ It's Takahisa who came in out of nowhere.
<1291> \ It's no wonder he knows something."
<1292> \{［伶］}
<1293> "......"
<1294> \{[Nue]}
<1295> "But even so, the military use of the power of the Angels,
<1296> \ Katagiri couldn't give up."
<1297> \{[Nue]}
<1298> "So, to remove the genetic defects that the Angel clones have,
<1299> \ I thought I could compensate by genetically combining it with another powerful life form."
<1300> \{[Nue]}
<1301> "A combination of human genes and angel genes,
<1302> \ The result of genetically engineered hybrids is

<1312> "Most individuals show no signs of manifesting their powers,
<1313> Only individuals that were no different from humans were born--"
<1314> \{[Nue]}
<1315> "So, let's aim to weaponize the power of the Angels.
<1316> \ This does not serve Katagiri's purpose.

<1319> "Without diminishing the power of the Angels,
<1320> \ Extend its life,
<1321> \ Continuing to seek combinations with clone individuals--"
<1322> \{[Nue]}
<1323> "What we ended up with was a mixture of Beast genes."
<1324> \{［伶］}
<1325> "Beast genes...?"
<1326> \{[Nue]}
<1327> "And thenーI was born.
<1328> \ A mixture of angel genes and beast genes,
<1329> \ As a chimera individual"
<1330> \{[Nue]}
<1331> "I'm not a pure Angel clone.

<1335> "This body may look exactly like yours,
<1336> \ I'm not like you.
<1337> \{[Nue]}
<1338> "There is something inside me that is the complete opposite of an angel,
<1339> \ I sense the beast--"
<1340> \{[Nue]}
<1341> "What kind of being is this 'beast'?
<1342> \ Again, like the Angel, Katagiri does not know the details.
<1343> \ It seems to have been provided by a sponsor, but--"
<1344> \{[Nue]}
<1345> "The best combination for strengthening an Angel is
<1346> \ An unknown beast,

<1370> \{[Nue]}
<1371> "Rei, the power of the perfect angel that lies within you,

<1373> \{[Nue]}
<1374> "That's why I came here.
<1375> \ ...to welcome you."
<1376> \{［伶］}
<1377> "To use me as research material...right?"
<1378> \{[Nue]}
<1379> "Now I long for you,

<1381> \{[Nue]}
<1382> "When you found out I was a failure,
<1383> \ He thought he had no choice but to get you."
<1384> \{[Nue]}
<1385> "But my own opinion is completely different.
<1386> \ You - the Angel,
<1387> \ I have no intention of letting Katagiri and the others get away with it."
<1388> \{[Nue]}
<1389> "Yes... I only think about using Angels as weapons.
<1390> \ That man's presence is a nuisance."
<1391> \{[Nue]}
<1392> "That man - I think it's time to get rid of him."
<1393> \{［伶］}
<1394> "Erase--?"
<1395> \{［伶］}
<1396> "You said that earlier too.
<1397> \ That's your power."
<1398> \{[Nue]}
<1399> "Yes, yes. Quite literally.

<1404> \{[Nue]}
<1405> "Rei--can you see this?"
<1406> Behind the young man who was asking Rei a question,
<1407> Suddenly, something large and transparent appears.
<1408> \{［伶］}
<1409> "Those are... wings...?"
<1410> Yesーit spreads across the young man's back,
<1411> It looked like a pair of black wings.
<1412> One wing alone is probably about two meters long.
<1413> Its surface, darker than night, radiates a mysterious brilliance,
<1414> The young man's back is adorned with a sinister yet elegant beauty.
<1415> It feels weightless and somewhat mirage-like.
<1416> What overwhelms those who see it is
<1417> It's not just the fantastical, long wings.
<1418> A strange wave emanates from the wings,
<1419> The air around them trembles and becomes tense.
<1420> \{[Nue]}
<1421> "It may look like wings growing from your back,
<1422> \ This is not exactly a physical entity."
<1423> \{[Nue]}
<1424> "The embodiment of my will,
<1425> \ A spiritual hand wielding its power to show the world my will."
<1426> \{[Nue]}
<1427> "Unable to be touched by human hands,
<1428> \ These are wings that only Angels possess--"
<1429> \{[Nue]}
<1430> "These wings bring death to those who see them,

<1435> "To all beings on earth,

<1438> "Within the reach of these wings,
<1439> \ No earthly weapon can harm me."
<1440> \{[Nue]}
<1441> "Because, those who touch the Black Wings,
<1442> \ Its existence would be immediately dissolved..."
<1443> \{［伶］}
<1444> "Unravel existence?"
<1445> \{[Nue]}
<1446> "That is the power that the Black Wings bring."
<1447> \{[Nue]}
<1448> "According to the words of Takahisa Kujo, a true angel is,
<1449> \ It is said that it has the power to control both the creation and destruction of existence..."
<1450> \{[Nue]}
<1451> "Giving form to the lifeless,
<1452> \ The power to give life,
<1453> \ The power to unravel the shape of existence and return everything to nothingness--"
<1454> \{[Nue]}
<1455> "Unfortunately, I was born with only the power of destruction."
<1456> \{[Nue]}
<1457> "But you, born as a perfect replica of an Angel,
<1458> \ He must possess both powers."
<1459> \{［伶］}
<1460> "The power to create existence, the power to unravel existence..."
<1461> \{[Nue]}
<1462> "When your power joins mine,
<1463> The range of the Black Wings and the power they exert are:
<1464> \ It will be even bigger and stronger."
<1465> \{[Nue]}
<1466> "The Black Wings can also change the world."
<1467> \{[Nue]}
<1468> "--Come with me, Rei."
<1469> \{[Nue]}
<1470> "If your power is added to mine, there will be no enemy on earth.
<1471> \ In this world, we can become the strongest creatures.
<1472> \{[Nue]}
<1473> "The earth is a miniature garden prepared for us angels.
<1474> \ If you don't like it, just tear it down and rebuild it."
<1475> \{[Nue]}
<1476> "Destroy or toy with,
<1477> \ The world is at our fingertips.
<1478> \{[Nue]}
<1479> "Come with me, Rei.
<1480> \ The present world and the narrow-mindedness of human hearts,
<1481> \ You must have felt despair too."
<1482> \{[Nue]}
<1483> "Don't tell me you didn't feel it.
<1484> \ The ugliness and foolishness of the human heart,
<1485> \ You've touched me enough times now..."
<1486> \{［伶］}
<1487> "You speak as if you've seen it before."
<1488> \{[Nue]}
<1489> "Yeah. I can feel it.
<1490> \ The loneliness, sadness, and despair that lie deep within your heart
<1491> \ I can sense it..."
<1492> \{［伶］}
<1493> "--!"
<1494> \{[Nue]}
<1495> "You understand, don't you, Rei?
<1496> \ You and I were originally one being.
<1497> \{[Nue]}
<1498> "Your loneliness, your despair,
<1499> \ I am the only one on earth who truly understands.
<1500> \{[Nue]}
<1501> "So――Rei,
<1502> \ Let's create the world we desire together."
<1503> \{[Nue]}
<1504> "...Destroy this world."
<1505> \{[Nue]}
<1506> "Together with me,
<1507> \ Let us witness the day of humanity's destruction--"
<1508> It is the darkest part of Rei's heart,
<1509> It was an inviting word that shook me to my core.
<1510> Seeing through the deep darkness of the human heart,
<1511> Give strength to the quiet feelings of anger and despair that lie within,
<1512> The eyes of an angel, as if forcibly awakening.
<1513> The more I yearn to destroy the world,
<1514> The eyes of the black-winged Angel,
<1515> I wonder if he has lived his life staring into the darkness of the human heart.
<1516> If it were Rei from a short time ago, she would have been able to see the darkness in this angel's heart.
<1517> The darkness whispers an ominous invitation,
<1518> The attraction may have been so strong that it was hard to resist.
<1519> But now...
<1520> \{［伶］}
<1521> "...It seems you can't sense it.
<1522> \ My heart is filled with more than just sadness and disappointment,
<1523> \ That it has already been fulfilled――」
<1524> \{［伶］}
<1525> "I have Takami."
<1526> \{［伶］}
<1527> "So... I can't go with you.
<1528> \ Because I don't wish to destroy the world."
<1529> \{[Takami]}
<1530> “Rei…!”
<1531> \{[Nue]}
<1532> "--You mean, because of my insignificant existence?"
<1533> \{[Nue]}
<1534> "Your attachment to the human world is
<1535> \ You think it's because of some worthless human being over there?"
<1536> \{［伶］}
<1537> "I don't think humans are worthless."
<1538> \{[Nue]}
<1539> "...I see."
<1540> \{[Nue]}
<1541> "I can't believe you're so moved by something like that.
<1542> \ - What a pity."
<1543> \{[Nue]}
<1544> "Then I will remove the chains that bind you to the earth,
<1545> \ I will cut it off with my own hands.
<1546> \{[Nue]}
<1547> "Turn that thing off."
<1548> \{［伶］}
<1549> "...!"
<1550> \{[Nue]}
<1551> "If you refuse to come, I will take you by force.
<1552> \ ...Cut off all your regrets."
<1553> The young man's cold declaration,
<1554> It was as if a sharp blade was being held to my neck.
<1555> A chilling tension runs through the room.
<1556> --Suddenly,
<1557> As if interrupting the young man,
<1558> A small electronic beep sounded.
<1559> \{[Nue]}
<1560> "Ah... a message from Katagiri."
<1561> In front of Rei and the others, who were amazed at what was happening,
<1562> The young man took out a small communication device from his pocket,
<1563> He turned it on with a very troublesome look on his face.
<1564> \{[Katagiri]}
<1565> “ーWhat’s going on over there?
<1566> \ I assume you have successfully secured your target?
<1567> \{[Katagiri]}
<1568> "Don't play around forever, if you catch your target,
<1569> \ Get back here quickly.
<1570> \{[Nue]}
<1571> "...He's still as noisy as ever."
<1572> From the other end of the radio came Katagiri's voice, rattling off noisily.
<1573> The young man, whose conversation with Rei was interrupted,
<1574> He frowns, clearly offended.
<1575> \{[Katagiri]}
<1576> 『Hey... are you listening?』
<1577> \{[Nue]}
<1578> "...You're really noisy. I'm talking to Rei.
<1579> \ Could you please not get in the way?
<1580> \{[Katagiri]}
<1581> 『What did you say?! Hey, Nue…!』
<1582> The young man ignored Katagiri's voice, who was still shouting something.
<1583> I quickly switched off the communication device,
<1584> He drops it on the floor and casually crushes it with the sole of his shoe.
<1585> \{[Nue]}
<1586> "...What an eyesore."
<1587> \{[Nue]}
<1588> "Yeah, I guess I'll just disappear tonight."
<1589> \{［伶］}
<1590> "...!"
<1591> The death sentence for Katagiri was coldly announced.
<1592> Rei heard the whispers,
<1593> I shudder at the ominous premonition that this pronouncement implies.
<1594> And then, at that moment.
<1595> Suddenly, the door to the entrance hall, to which the young man had turned,
<1596> It was wide open from the outside.
<1597> \{[Takami]}
<1598> "What――!?"
<1599> In front of Rei and the others, who were holding their breath, a man wearing a black bulletproof suit appeared.
<1600> Armed with automatic rifles at their hips,
<1601> About six men entered the mansion with loud footsteps.
<1602> \{[Nue]}
<1603> "...So you're here already."
<1604> \{[Takami]}
<1605> "You... Katagiri!"
<1606> Seeing one of the intruders alertly holding a rifle,
<1607> Takami shouts in anger.
<1608> When I looked, sure enough, Katagiri was there, hiding among them.
<1609> \{[Katagiri]}
<1610> "Oh my, my, Takami-sama, Rei-sama.
<1611> \ I'm glad to hear that you're all in good health.
<1612> \{[Takami]}
<1613> "You traitor, you speak so innocently...!"
<1614> \{[Katagiri]}
<1615> "I am truly sorry,
<1616> \ Takami-sama..."
<1617> \{[Katagiri]}
<1618> "Even if it is to obtain an Angel,
<1619> \ I have to get rid of you,
<1620> \ My heart aches."
<1621> \{[Katagiri]}
<1622> "I'll ask again,
<1623> \ Thank you for handing over Rei-san to me so kindly.
<1624> \ Are you planning to resign?
<1625> \{[Takami]}
<1626> "I'm not going to hand Rei over to you...!"
<1627> \{[Katagiri]}
<1628> "That's unfortunate..."
<1629> \{[Katagiri]}
<1630> "But now, more importantly - Nue!"
<1631> Katagiri stepped forward in front of the young man with a clearly displeased expression on his face,
<1632> He questioned in an angry voice.
<1633> \{[Katagiri]}
<1634> "What are you thinking, Nue?
<1635> \ unilaterally cut off communication from me,
<1636> \ Stop acting on your own..."
<1637> \{[Katagiri]}
<1638> "Once you have secured the Angel,
<1639> \ Bring him to me quickly!
<1640> \{[Nue]}
<1641> "...I won't give Rei to you.
<1642> \ I'll take Rei."
<1643> \{[Katagiri]}
<1644> "Huh..."
<1645> \{[Katagiri]}
<1646> "Nue... Are you planning to defy me?"
<1647> \{[Nue]}
<1648> "If you don't give up and still seek the Angel,
<1649> \ That can't be helped..."
<1650> \{[Katagiri]}
<1651> "A mad dog... is going to bite my hand?!"
<1652> \{[Katagiri]}
<1653> "Hmph, what a mad dog that breaks free from its master's reins and bares its fangs,
<1654> \ It's too dangerous to leave it alone...!"
<1655> \{[Katagiri]}
<1656> "It's unfortunate to lose one of your valuable pieces,
<1657> \ You'll die, Nue--!"
<1658> A crooked smile tugged at the corner of his lips.
<1659> Katagiri turned on the switch of the small remote control device in his hand.
<1660> Turn it on for show.
<1661> However――
<1662> Nothing happens.
<1663> \{[Katagiri]}
<1664> "Wh-What? What's going on here?!"
<1665> Katagiri looked confused.
<1666> Press the switch on the device over and over again.
<1667> But still nothing happens.
<1668> \{[Katagiri]}
<1669> "What?! Why is there no reaction?
<1670> \ How ridiculous... Did it break at such a crucial time?
<1671> \{[Nue]}
<1672> "You really are a foolish man..."
<1673> \{[Nue]}
<1674> "If you can keep me under your control forever with that device,
<1675> \ I honestly believed it."
<1676> \{[Nue]}
<1677> "The toy you had me make was disabled a long time ago.
<1678> \ The power of my Black Wings,
<1679> \ It's not just about showing it to the outside world.
<1680> \{[Nue]}
<1681> "During the days when I was treated as an experimental subject,
<1682> \ There was plenty of time to sharpen his fangs and gather his strength."
<1683> \{[Nue]}
<1684> "So, you can turn your strength within yourself,
<1685> \ I tried it..."
<1686> \{[Nue]}
<1687> "The results are as you can see."
<1688> \{[Katagiri]}
<1689> "Nue... you...!"
<1690> \{[Nue]}
<1691> "I pretended your device was effective.
<1692> \ I was just waiting for an opportunity.
<1693> \{[Nue]}
<1694> "Until now, I have been trying to get people to seek ways to prolong their lives.
<1695> \ I stayed with youー"
<1696> \{[Nue]}
<1697> "But... I don't need you anymore. I don't need you or anything you bring.
<1698> \ I won't need it anymore."
<1699> \{[Nue]}
<1700> "From today, Rei has been with me..."
<1701> \{[Nue]}
<1702> "So--"
<1703> \{[Nue]}
<1704> "I'll destroy every single one of you..."
<1705> \{[Katagiri]}
<1706> "You... you're not planning to betray me, Nue...?!"
<1707> \{[Nue]}
<1708> "Calling it a betrayal... how rude.
<1709> \ I never intended to follow you from the start.
<1710> \{[Nue]}
<1711> "So it's not a betrayal.
<1712> \ This is just a warding off evil spirits."
<1713> \{[Katagiri]}
<1714> "Y-You...!"
<1715> \{[Nue]}
<1716> "--Rei. And then there's the head of the Kujo family.
<1717> \ Let me show you guys.
<1718> \{[Nue]}
<1719> "A glimpse of the power of the Angels--"
<1720> On the young man's back, once again,
<1721> The wings of an angel, which he called the Black Wings, materialize.
<1722> Dark light - if there is such a thing,
<1723> This makes me think that it refers to such an entity.
<1724> Jet black wings filled with a dark glow.
<1725> The folded wings slowly unfold,
<1726> The pressure released from its wings
<1727> The air around me becomes so tense that it almost makes my ears ring.
<1728> \{[Subordinate]}
<1729> "Wh-what is that...?!"
<1730> Was it the first time some of the intruders had seen it?
<1731> Suddenly appeared on the young man's back,
<1732> A voice rises in fear at the long, dark shadow.
<1733> \{[Katagiri]}
<1734> "You guys, calm down!
<1735> \ As long as you don't fall within the range of those Black Wings, there will be no effect!
<1736> As expected, Katagiri, who had studied the <Angel>,
<1737> He seems to be knowledgeable about the young man's powers, as he hastily gives out instructions.
<1738> However, the strange intimidation emanating from this otherworldly being,
<1739> People who are unfamiliar with the situation feel intimidated and nervous.
<1740> \{[Nue]}
<1741> "Now, who do you want to be erased by...?"
<1742> The young man seemed to enjoy the men's fear,
<1743> The smile on his lips deepened and he whispered ominously.
<1744> It appeals to the instinct to fear heresy,
<1745> A beautiful yet sinister smile that stirs fear in the hearts of men.
<1746> \{[Subordinate]}
<1747> "Uh... Uwaaaah...!"
<1748> One of them could not bear the extreme tension,
<1749> In a state of near-delirium, he aimed his rifle at the young man and fired.
<1750> \{[Katagiri]}
<1751> "Wait! Don't fire yet!"
<1752> A bullet fired at high speed from the muzzle of a rifle,
<1753> If you continue straight ahead,
<1754> It was supposed to tear the young man to shreds.
<1755> is――
<1756> \{[Subordinate]}
<1757> "The bullets... have disappeared!?"
<1758> The bullets aimed at the chest missed their target,
<1759> I turned towards the young man standing there with a smile on his face,
<1760> Just before that, it reached a certain point and disappeared in an instant.
<1761> \{[Subordinate]}
<1762> "That's ridiculous... the bullets just disappeared?
<1763> \ That's impossible!
<1764> \{［Male］}
<1765> "But, it's true, the bullets..."
<1766> \{[Subordinate]}
<1767> "Does the gun not work on him...?!"
<1768> The panicked intruders opened fire one after the other.
<1769> They rained bullets down on the young man,
<1770> Not a single shot reaches the young man.
<1771> \{[Katagiri]}
<1772> "You, you, idiots...!
<1773> \ Don't fire yet!
<1774> \{[Katagiri]}
<1775> "Calm down and look at the color of the Black Wings!
<1776> \ Even if you shoot in this state, physical attacks won't work on him!"
<1777> Katagiri's earnest words,
<1778> This goes unheard by his terrified subordinates.
<1779> \{[Nue]}
<1780> "...Under these Black Wings,
<1781> \ You can't hurt me."
<1782> As the young man coldly declared with a sneer,
<1783> The bullets will not harm him.
<1784> Because the bullets fired at him
<1785> The moment I reached a point about two meters in front of the young man,
<1786> Because everything emits light and disappears.
<1787> An invisible barrier protects the young man,
<1788> Sensing the hostility directed at him,
<1789> It was a strange sight, as if the bullets were being burned to ashes by an invisible flame.
<1790> \{[Subordinate]}
<1791> "Wh... why isn't it hitting me?
<1792> \ Why do the bullets disappear mid-fire...!
<1793> \{[Subordinate]}
<1794> "It's a monster...!"
<1795> Amid a deadly hail of gunfire,
<1796> With a cool expression, like being hit by a pleasant May shower,
<1797> The young man walks forward, maintaining a steady pace.
<1798> Like a spark that scatters in an instant,
<1799> The bullet that reached the young man's side emitted a flash of light the moment it disappeared.
<1800> Flickering in the darkness.
<1801> \{[Subordinate]}
<1802> "That can't be... a lie!?"
<1803> \{[Subordinate]}
<1804> "S-Stop it... Don't come...!
<1805> \ Don't come, you monster...!"
<1806> \{[Katagiri]}
<1807> "You idiots, calm down!
<1808> \ If we stay calm and deal with this, we can deal with his power..."
<1809> He hurls words of rebuke at his confused subordinates,
<1810> The young man looks at Katagiri with contempt and mutters coldly.
<1811> \{[Nue]}
<1812> "Oh, that's right -- you were there.
<1813> \ I was used as a test subject for Angel research,
<1814> \ You treated me as you pleased..."
<1815> \{[Katagiri]}
<1816> "Uh..."
<1817> \{[Nue]}
<1818> "You will learn of my power,
<1819> \ He was one of the few people..."
<1820> \{[Nue]}
<1821> "The field I was deployed to was always,
<1822> \ Attempt to invade alone and eliminate everyone there,
<1823> \ It was all covert mopping-up operations."
<1824> \{[Nue]}
<1825> "With people from other teams,
<1826> \ I have never acted together with him..."
<1827> \{[Nue]}
<1828> "Those who know the details of how the Black Wings are activated,
<1829> \ Only those involved at command level--"
<1830> \{[Nue]}
<1831> "So, besides you, there is no one else here.
<1832> \ No one knows the details of my powers."
<1833> \{[Nue]}
<1834> "So, if I erase you,
<1835> \ The rest are just a bunch of rabble."
<1836> \{[Nue]}
<1837> "If the device that was supposed to control me doesn't work,
<1838> \ You have no way of controlling me--"
<1839> \{[Nue]}
<1840> "So... what should we do?"
<1841> \{[Katagiri]}
<1842> "Hi――!"
<1843> \{[Katagiri]}
<1844> "Shoot! Shoot him!"
<1845> \{[Katagiri]}
<1846> "Shoot, shoot, keep shooting...!
<1847> \ Until those Black Wings disappear,
<1848> \ Never let up on your attacks!"
<1849> Katagiri's scream, which sounded like a shriek, was the signal.
<1850> The shooting, which had stopped for a moment, resumes...
<1851> As expected, the young man will not be harmed.
<1852> The flash of a muzzle flash,
<1853> The bullets that were spat out scattered in front of the young man, and the light disappeared.
<1854> Instantly illuminates the world on a moonlit night.
<1855> \{[Nue]}
<1856> "...That's pointless. With this level of firepower,
<1857> \ My power cannot be defeated."
<1858> \{[Nue]}
<1859> "I'm tired of putting up with your farce.
<1860> \ -- I'll have you disappear."
<1861> The young man's body kicked the floor,
<1862> In an instant, he jumps into the midst of the intruders.
<1863> \{[Katagiri]}
<1864> "No good...! You guys, hurry up and fire!"
<1865> \{[Subordinate]}
<1866> "No... No!"
<1867> \{[Subordinate]}
<1868> "It's moving so fast... I can't catch it!"
<1869> \{[Subordinate]}
<1870> "At this position, we're fighting each other..."
<1871> The movement was so agile,
<1872> Before they could escape, several of the intruders
<1873> He is drawn into a space dominated by young people.
<1874> Katagiri was seen giving instructions to his subordinates.
<1875> He was one of those few.
<1876> \{[Nue]}
<1877> "Well... I got him."
<1878> What will happen? Rei and the others watch with bated breath.
<1879> The men, ready to fire their guns, stop moving.
<1880> \{[Katagiri]}
<1881> "Damn... Stop this... Nue...!"
<1882> \{[Subordinate]}
<1883> "I, I can't move...!?"
<1884> Humans who are drawn into the sphere of control of the Black Wings,
<1885> As if trapped by invisible arms,
<1886> Will you be bound by power and unable to move?
<1887> \{[Katagiri]}
<1888> "I... I'm your... creator!
<1889> \ And now... like this...!
<1890> As if trying to dispel the rising fear,
<1891> Katagiri raises his voice in anger,
<1892> As if frozen, I was unable to move.
<1893> \{[Nue]}
<1894> "...What is that?
<1895> \ Should I respect a foolish being like you?
<1896> \ You say stupid things.
<1897> \{[Nue]}
<1898> "I am so grateful to have someone like you as my Creator,
<1899> \ I would only lament, but I have no gratitude.
<1900> \ I wonder why you don't know..."
<1901> \{[Nue]}
<1902> "Well, it's time to say goodbye."
<1903> \{[Nue]}
<1904> "Goodbye, greedy, foolish man.
<1905> \ It makes me happy to think that I will never see your face again.
<1906> As the young man said his farewell,
<1907> Katagiri and his subordinates' bodies,
<1908> Just like the bullet that disappeared before the young man, he is enveloped in light.
<1909> \{[Katagiri]}
<1910> "What...?! S-Stop it...!"
<1911> Katagiri's voice in despair
<1912> Slowly - I am swallowed up in the light.
<1913> And thenーthe men disappear into the light.
<1914> People, things, everything,
<1915> Slowly - until it becomes a fragment of light,
<1916> Its existence is unravelled and it disappears.
<1917> \{[Katagiri]}
<1918> "This is... stupid...!"
<1919> Unable to escape the control of the Black Wings, he was enveloped in a white light.
<1920> All existence is reduced to light――
<1921> They... disappeared.
<1922> \{[Takami]}
<1923> "Katagiri... has disappeared...?
<1924> \ What on earth is going on..."
<1925> Perhaps he had heard Takami's stunned mutterings,
<1926> A young man with his wings spread wide answers.
<1927> \{[Nue]}
<1928> "What is the power of the Black Wings?
<1929> \ I myself, who exercise it, don't know for sure.
<1930> \{[Nue]}
<1931> "Take people and things under your wings,
<1932> \ The power of the Angels, which can even unravel into light..."
<1933> \{[Nue]}
<1934> "The power to transform the very source of existence..."
<1935> \{[Nue]}
<1936> "This world and the beings in it,
<1937> \ The power to unravel the laws of causality--"
<1938> \{[Nue]}
<1939> "Well, I guess this power is something like that.
<1940> \ I'm thinking
<1941> \{［伶］}
<1942> "Unraveling the causal laws of existence..."
<1943> The power released from the Black Wings,
<1944> The very foundations of our existence that are necessary for us to exist in this world are shaken,
<1945> Disconnected from the world and disappearing.
<1946> Rearranging molecular structures,
<1947> It takes place on a level far beyond that.
<1948> Rewriting of existence information――
<1949> Indeed, this can only be described as the power of an angel.
<1950> It is a heretical power beyond the control of humans.
<1951> \{[Nue]}
<1952> "Now, the rest of you,
<1953> \ I'll untie you all and erase you from this world."
<1954> \{[Subordinate]}
<1955> "Uh... Uwaaaah!"
<1956> \{[Subordinate]}
<1957> "Stop... Help me...!"
<1958> The battle between the young man and the intruder that followed was
<1959> The situation became one-sided.
<1960> The invaders' attacks never reached the target.
<1961> The young man's wings flutter, and each time a person disappears into the light.
<1962> Overwhelmed by the heretical power wielded by a young man calling himself Nue,
<1963> He taps Takami on the shoulder and whispers.
<1964> \{［伶］}
<1965> "--Takami, pull yourself together."
<1966> \{[Takami]}
<1967> "Eh? Ah, Rei...!?"
<1968> \{［伶］}
<1969> "Let's get out of here now."
<1970> \{[Takami]}
<1971> "Oh, that's right..."
<1972> Relying only on the faint moonlight,
<1973> Rei and Takami continue running down the hallway as fast as they can.
<1974> Butーsoon after, the gunfire stopped,
<1975> The mansion was once again enveloped in silence.
<1976> \{[Takami]}
<1977> "--That guy, no way,
<1978> \ Have you already defeated that many people?
<1979> \{[Takami]}
<1980> "Damn, it's too early...!"
<1981> I ran as hard as I could, thinking of a way to escape.
<1982> There was never enough time to do anything.
<1983> The presence behind Rei is chasing her, gradually closing the distance.
<1984> I don't even need to look back to confirm it.
<1985> \{[Takami]}
<1986> "Oh no! They've already caught up with me...!"
<1987> When I turned around after hearing Takami's words, I sensed a young man approaching in the distance.
<1988> \{[Takami]}
<1989> "Rei, run away!
<1990> \ I'll hold him back...!"
<1991> Takami shouted sharply at Rei, then pulled out a gun from his pocket.
<1992> He aimed the gun at the young man.
<1993> \{［伶］}
<1994> "Are you planning to fight with just that one gun?
<1995> \ That's unreasonable...!"
<1996> \{［伶］}
<1997> "You know guns don't work on him."
<1998> \{[Takami]}
<1999> "But even so, I love you,
<2000> \ I absolutely don't want to hand it over to him...!"
<2001> \{［伶］}
<2002> "Takami..."
<2003> \{[Takami]}
<2004> "Just run away and ignore me!"
<2005> \{［伶］}
<2006> "...I don't want to. There's no point in me running away alone.
<2007> \ If you stay, I'll stay too.
<2008> \{[Takami]}
<2009> "You...!
<2010> \ You never listen to what I say!"
<2011> \{［伶］}
<2012> "Isn't that the usual thing?"
<2013> To the approaching youth,
<2014> Takami swallowed hard and pulled the trigger.
<2015> However――
<2016> The young man spread his black wings,
<2017> He blocks all of Takami's bullets.
<2018> \{[Takami]}
<2019> "Damn it...! It doesn't seem to be working after all...!"
<2020> Takami, who had fired all the bullets in his gun,
<2021> I hastily took out a spare magazine from my pocket,
<2022> Attempts to reload.
<2023> However, while Takami was struggling with the unfamiliar controls,
<2024> The young man, having erased his Black Wings, sprints off.
<2025> \{［伶］}
<2026> "Takami, it's dangerous--!"
<2027> \{[Takami]}
<2028> "What...?!"
<2029> Takami looked up in surprise and saw a young man approaching him.
<2030> Rei quickly pushes Takami away,
<2031> A young man suddenly attacks in his place.
<2032> \{［伶］}
<2033> "Ugh...!"
<2034> \{[Takami]}
<2035> “Rei…!”
<2036> The young man's arm grabbed him by the collar,
<2037> Then he pushes Rei's body against the wall behind her.
<2038> The pain of being squeezed by those strong arms
<2039> I can't help but get out of breath.
<2040> \{[???]}
<2041> "If you do anything more cruel to Rei-sama,
<2042> \ Stop it!
<2043> \{[???]}
<2044> "I won't let anyone lay a hand on you two...!"
<2045> A sharp, angry voice from a young girl said.
<2046> echoed down the dark hallway.
<2047> \{[Nue]}
<2048> "...Who are you?"
<2049> \{［伶］}
<2050> "Are you... Marie?!"
<2051> From the depths of the darkness, she fixed her dignified gaze on the young man,
<2052> Marie appears under the moonlight.
<2053> \{[Mari]}
<2054> "If you intend to lay hands on the two of them any further,
<2055> \ I'll be your opponent...!"
<2056> \{[Takami]}
<2057> "Mari...! Are you okay?"
<2058> \{[Mari]}
<2059> "Sorry for the delay,
<2060> \ Rei-sama, Takami-sama!
<2061> \{［伶］}
<2062> "...That's right! What happened to Nozomi?"
<2063> \{[Mari]}
<2064> "Nozomi is already hiding in a safe place.
<2065> \ Please rest assured.
<2066> \{[Mari]}
<2067> "Are you both uninjured?
<2068> \ We will help you immediately..."
<2069> \{［伶］}
<2070> "! Don't come over here!
<2071> \ You alone must escape from this mansion!
<2072> \{[Mari]}
<2073> "Protecting Rei-sama is
<2074> \ It's an important mission that I decided on myself."
<2075> \{[Mari]}
<2076> "I will protect you!"
<2077> \{[Mari]}
<2078> "I have your protection,
<2079> \ Because we have the “power”
<2080> \{［伶］}
<2081> “Power…”
<2082> \{[Mari]}
<2083> "Please leave this to me!"
<2084> Used to stir firewood in the old oven in the kitchen,
<2085> A fire poker with a claw-shaped tip.
<2086> Marie clutched it in her right hand,
<2087> He glared at the young man and declared.
<2088> \{[Mari]}
<2089> "Now, I'll take care of things from here on.
<2090> \ I won't let anyone lay a hand on Rei-sama!"
<2091> Marie readied herself as if she were holding a sword.
<2092> He holds the poker up in front of his chest.
<2093> He touched the shaft with his left hand and slowly slid his palm down.
<2094> Thenーthe old, rusty iron bar,
<2095> The place where Marie touched was enveloped in a dazzling light.
<2096> \{［伶］}
<2097> "What's that light...?"
<2098> That radiance will be there when the Black Wings are released from existence.
<2099> It is very similar to the light emitted by things that are being unraveled.
<2100> \{［伶］}
<2101> (They're similarーor rather, the same thing...?)
<2102> As I watched in amazement, the light unraveled,
<2103> A short spear with a shining silver surface appeared.
<2104> \{［伶］}
<2105> "That can't be... that's...!"
<2106> \{［伶］}
<2107> "Is this the same power as the Angels, which allows them to rewrite existence...?"
<2108> \{[Nue]}
<2109> "...Who are you?"
<2110> \{[Nue]}
<2111> "Your power is equal to that of an Angel, right?"
<2112> \{[Nue]}
<2113> "But besides Kujo Takahisa and that man,
<2114> \ To think that there is a human being who has obtained the blood of an Angel,
<2115> \ I haven't been told--"
<2116> \{[Nue]}
<2117> "Who created you, an angel?"
<2118> \{[Mari]}
<2119> "...to you,
<2120> \ I have no intention of answering that question.
<2121> \{［伶］}
<2122> "Mari, who exactly are you...?"
<2123> \{[Mari]}
<2124> "I amーI am your protector."
<2125> \{[Mari]}
<2126> "To repay the kindness you showed me long ago,
<2127> \ I've come to your side.
<2128> \{[Mari]}
<2129> "As he himself said,
<2130> \ It is not a perfect being.
<2131> \ Then I'm sure I can fight with my own strength."
<2132> \{[Nue]}
<2133> "...Interesting. Instead of Rei,
<2134> \ You say you'll fight me?
<2135> \{[Nue]}
<2136> "I don't know how much power it has,
<2137> \ Then, I'll have you be my partner."
<2138> \{[Nue]}
<2139> "I'd like to see what you can do!"
<2140> The young man slowly approached Marie,
<2141> It spread its jet-black wings wide, covering the surrounding area.
<2142> \{［伶］}
<2143> "Mari...!"
<2144> Takami rushed over to Rei and supported her.
<2145> I saw Marie being consumed by the power of the young man's Black Wings.
<2146> Even if you are trapped under the weight of the invisible power emitted by the Black Wings,
<2147> There is no sign of agitation on Marie's face.
<2148> The power of the Angels is concentrated in one point,
<2149> With Marie as the focus of power,
<2150> That being was meant to be unwound into light.
<2151> But――
<2152> \{［伶］}
<2153> "It won't go away...?"
<2154> A wave of light that shakes the very foundations of existence,
<2155> After it finally calmed down,
<2156> There was a young man looking at Marie with a sarcastic smile.
<2157> \{[Nue]}
<2158> "...I guess the power of the Black Wings doesn't work on you after all."
<2159> \{[Nue]}
<2160> "Resonating with the sound of the Black Wings,
<2161> \ Can we neutralize the power being released...?
<2162> \{[Mari]}
<2163> "--Next, I'll come from here!"
<2164> Marie held the short spear in one hand,
<2165> He aimed accurately at the young man's chest and threw the bullet.
<2166> The young man's Black Wings block the blow.
<2167> At that moment, while the spear was being unwound by the light,
<2168> Marie bends over, touches her hands to the floor, and closes her eyes.
<2169> Centering on the place where Marie touched,
<2170> Thorny tendrils made of steel grew from the floor like living creatures.
<2171> The thorny vines attack the young man.
<2172> \{[Nue]}
<2173> "――――!"
<2174> The young man uses the power of his Black Wings to protect himself from the thorns' attacks,
<2175> Jump down and put some distance between you.
<2176> \{[Nue]}
<2177> "You're amazing!
<2178> \ There is no Angel strong enough to fight me,
<2179> \ Katagiri's laboratory doesn't have one.
<2180> \{[Nue]}
<2181> "Who are you?
<2182> \ How did you obtain that power?"
<2183> \{[Mari]}
<2184> "I'm not going to answer that for you!"
<2185> It must have been hidden in the cuff of the young man's arm, and with a flick of the young man's arm,
<2186> A thin, sharp knife appears at his fingertips.
<2187> The young man kicked the floor and approached,
<2188> He threw the knife sharply at Marie.
<2189> Marie dodged the knife that came at her like a flash of light, but
<2190> Another knife had appeared out of nowhere,
<2191> The young man approaches closely.
<2192> \{[Mari]}
<2193> "Ugh--!"
<2194> Marie barely manages to dodge the young man's attacks,
<2195> It's only a matter of time before we're cornered.
<2196> And thenーfinally, the young man's knife,
<2197> Pierced Marie's arm.
<2198> \{［伶］}
<2199> "Mari--!!"
<2200> \{[Nue]}
<2201> "--? Wait a sec, what does this feel like--?"
<2202> \{[Mari]}
<2203> "...Ha!"
<2204> Pierced by the knife,
<2205> Marie swung her arm with all her might and touched the wall,
<2206> The wall transforms and thorns appear, attacking the young man.
<2207> \{[Nue]}
<2208> "Ugh...!"
<2209> The young man narrowly avoids it.
<2210> \{[Mari]}
<2211> "...I'm sorry to disappoint you,
<2212> \ With an attack of this magnitude,
<2213> \ You can't defeat me."
<2214> \{[Nue]}
<2215> "The feeling I'm getting now - his high physical ability and toughness."
<2216> \{[Nue]}
<2217> "Your body... is not something a human could possess."
<2218> \{[Mari]}
<2219> "Yes. My body,
<2220> \ It's a little different from that of a living human."
<2221> \{[Mari]}
<2222> "Thanks to you,
<2223> \ I have gained the strength to compete with you."
<2224> \{[Mari]}
<2225> "It's not easy to defeat me."
<2226> \{[Nue]}
<2227> "--Yes. That certainly seems to be the case."
<2228> \{[Nue]}
<2229> "If you underestimate a cute girl,
<2230> \ We may be the ones who get caught off guard--"
<2231> \{[Takami]}
<2232> "...This is bad. From his point of view,
<2233> \ The light of contempt for the opponent has disappeared.
<2234> \{[Takami]}
<2235> "I don't know how much power Marie has,
<2236> \ If the forces are balanced,
<2237> \ The more experience you have, the more mentally your opponent has the advantage.
<2238> \{[Takami]}
<2239> "If the gaps created by carelessness are eliminated from the other side,
<2240> \ Marie's battle situation is becoming increasingly difficult..."
<2241> \{［伶］}
<2242> "Mari..."
<2243> \{[Mari]}
<2244> "Unlike my body, yours is
<2245> \ No different from a fragile human being..."
<2246> \{[Mari]}
<2247> "If I can break through your defenses, even my own strength can defeat you."
<2248> \{[Nue]}
<2249> "Now that we know that,
<2250> \ Defeating me won't be that easy."
<2251> \{[Nue]}
<2252> "You're not as used to fighting as I am."
<2253> The young man responded with a sneer to Marie's words,
<2254> He turned around and easily jumped into Marie's arms.
<2255> \{[Mari]}
<2256> "Kya...!"
<2257> I hastily stepped back, and Marie stretched out her arm to touch the wall.
<2258> He raised his palm strike, ready to strike from his hip, and deflected it.
<2259> The young man delivered a mid-level kick to Marie's stomach.
<2260> \{[Mari]}
<2261> "Ahhh..."
<2262> The kick knocked my body back, and my back slammed into the wall.
<2263> Marie crouches on the floor and coughs.
<2264> The young man slowly approached Marie,
<2265> He looks down fearlessly at his defeated opponent and mutters.
<2266> \{[Nue]}
<2267> "The difference in experience gained in previous battles...
<2268> \ And that's how the difference in strength between you and me became--"
<2269> \{[Mari]}
<2270> "Ugh!"
<2271> Marie flipped her body over and stood up.
<2272> I put my hands on the floor and closed my eyes.
<2273> The being changes according to Marie's will.
<2274> The walls of thorns stretched out in layers, ten and twenty,
<2275> Completely block the hallway from ceiling to floor.
<2276> The young man stands in his way, hidden behind the thorns.
<2277> \{[Mari]}
<2278> "This should buy us some time.
<2279> \ Come on... let's get out of here while we can!
<2280> Marie stood up, staggering a little,
<2281> He led Rei and Takami out and ran.
<2282> \{[Nue]}
<2283> "...There's no point in running away, Rei.
<2284> \ I'll catch up with you soon."
<2285> \{[Nue]}
<2286> "Now, how far will you guys go with me?
<2287> \ Can you resist...?
<2288> From the other side of the thorn wall, I sense the young man's cold laughter.
<2289> It gradually became more distant.
<2290> The young man still wasn't taking Rei and the others seriously.
<2291> Fortunately, there was no sign of them cornering us.
<2292> This is the time when he shows his composure and doesn't attack with all his might.
<2293> This is probably one of the few chances of victory given to Rei and the others.
<2294> Before the young man noticed,
<2295> We must find a way to turn the tide.
<2296> \{［伶］}
<2297> (However... if there is no way to deal with the Black Wings,
<2298> \ You can't escape him.)
<2299> \{［伶］}
<2300> (What should I do...?)
<2301> \{[Mari]}
<2302> "Lord Rei, Lord Takami,
<2303> \ Please come here!
<2304> I entered one of the doors along the long corridor.
<2305> Marie beckoned the two into her room.
<2306> The mysterious power that the young man called the power of an angel,
<2307> Marie showed how easy it was to use.
<2308> Who exactly is she?
<2309> For just a moment, Rei hesitated about what to do,
<2310> Seeing Marie's face, who is still trying her best to save Rei and Nozomi,
<2311> Any doubts about his heart will disappear.
<2312> Whatever Marie's true identity,
<2313> The affection and love that the girl had shown to Rei and Takami up until now,
<2314> I felt I could trust them.
<2315> \{［伶］}
<2316> "...I'm on my way."
<2317> Rei also entered the room as Marie called him.
<2318> \{[Mari]}
<2319> "Rei-sama, I'm sorry...!"
<2320> \{[Mari]}
<2321> "With my immature strength alone,
<2322> \ It seems we can't compete with him..."
<2323> \{［伶］}
<2324> "There's no need to apologize, you've fought hard enough."
<2325> \{[Mari]}
<2326> "It is very frustrating,
<2327> \ My strength is no match for his..."
<2328> \{[Mari]}
<2329> "I'm not a real Angel,
<2330> \ There is a limit to the power I can exercise..."
<2331> \{［伶］}
<2332> "Are you... really not an Angel?
<2333> \ Even though he had mastered such great power--"
<2334> \{[Mari]}
<2335> "Yes. I just...
<2336> \ I'm just borrowing the power of the Angels."
<2337> \{［伶］}
<2338> "...Mari, please tell me the truth.
<2339> \ Is there anything I can do to defeat him?"
<2340> \{［伶］}
<2341> "The power of the Angel he desires,
<2342> \ If I really have it,
<2343> \ Is there something I can do?
<2344> \{[Mari]}
<2345> "...involving Rei-sama in the battle,
<2346> \ I wanted to avoid it..."
<2347> \{[Mari]}
<2348> "I will give to Rei-sama the power of my angel,
<2349> \ If you give me everything..."
<2350> \{［伶］}
<2351> "You think we might find a chance?"
<2352> \{[Mari]}
<2353> "Yes, or..."
<2354> \{[Mari]}
<2355> "The power you possess,
<2356> \ If we combine our strengths,
<2357> \ I wonder if I can surpass his power..."
<2358> \{[Takami]}
<2359> "Giving up your power...!
<2360> \ Marie, are you capable of doing that?
<2361> \{[Mari]}
<2362> "Of course, the power of the Angel that I possess,
<2363> \ Because you have the capacity to accept everything,
<2364> \ It's possible, but..."
<2365> \{［伶］}
<2366> "--Mari. Wait a moment.
<2367> \ So what happens to you?
<2368> \ If I give you all my power, what will you do...?
<2369> \{[Mari]}
<2370> "...Thanks to this power, I have survived,
<2371> \ My life will be gone, but that's fine."
<2372> \{[Mari]}
<2373> "To repay Rei-sama's kindness,
<2374> \ It's like I've been able to keep this life going until today."
<2375> \{[Mari]}
<2376> "Rei-sama, please,
<2377> \ Let me repay your kindness...!"
<2378> \{［伶］}
<2379> "But even so, you will disappear for us,
<2380> \ I still think it's wrong."
<2381> \{[Mari]}
<2382> "But--!"
<2383> \ There's no other way out of this situation!
<2384> \{[Mari]}
<2385> "I told Rei-sama and Takami-sama,
<2386> \ I want you to be happy more than anyone else...!"
<2387> \{[Takami]}
<2388> "--Wait! I know how to weaken his power!"
<2389> \{[Mari]}
<2390> "Eh... Takami-sama, what method is that...?"
<2391> \{[Takami]}
<2392> "Rei, that's the stone! It weakens the power of the Angels.
<2393> \ Use that stone!
<2394> \{[Takami]}
<2395> "You remember, right?
<2396> \ I'm sure you brought that back to this mansion."
<2397> \{[Takami]}
<2398> "If we use that effectively,
<2399> \ It might help us defeat him."
<2400> \{［伶］}
<2401> "Right... that stone!"
<2402> \{［伶］}
<2403> "If he is the same being as me,
<2404> \ The effect of the stone that had such an effect on me was,
<2405> \ The same should be shown to him--"
<2406> \{[Takami]}
<2407> "At the very least, I'd like to get some revenge on him.
<2408> \ Isn't that possible?
<2409> \{［伶］}
<2410> "Yes... that's right."
<2411> \{[Takami]}
<2412> "Rei, where is that stone?"
<2413> \{［伶］}
<2414> "It's in my room. It's still in the box on my desk."
<2415> \{[Takami]}
<2416> "I see--"
<2417> \{[Takami]}
<2418> "--Okay, everyone, hear my thoughts."
<2419> \{[Takami]}
<2420> "His attention is now
<2421> \ It is directed only at Rei and Marie.
<2422> \{[Takami]}
<2423> "He completely underestimated me as just a human being,
<2424> \ I completely ignore it.
<2425> \{[Takami]}
<2426> "--That's where we're aiming."
<2427> \{[Takami]}
<2428> "I'll go get the stone. Meanwhile,
<2429> \ Make sure you catch his eye here."
<2430> \{［伶］}
<2431> "Okay. I'll take that role."
<2432> \{［伶］}
<2433> "Mari, the power of your angel,
<2434> \ Could you lend me enough so that you don't disappear?
<2435> \{［伶］}
<2436> "He's targeting me. If I fight him,
<2437> \ No life will be taken away."
<2438> \{[Mari]}
<2439> "That's too dangerous! I'll be the decoy--"
<2440> \{［伶］}
<2441> "No, you'll get killed by him."
<2442> \{［伶］}
<2443> "I won't be killed,
<2444> \ If done well, it can buy you a lot of time.
<2445> \ ...There's no need for you to sacrifice your life in vain."
<2446> \{[Mari]}
<2447> "Rei-sama..."
<2448> \{［伶］}
<2449> "Now, Marie, give me your power..."
<2450> \{[Mari]}
<2451> "Yes!"
<2452> \{[Mari]}
<2453> "...Ah!"
<2454> \{[Mari]}
<2455> "Ummm... Takami-sama, this is an emergency, so
<2456> \ Please don't get angry...?
<2457> \{[Takami]}
<2458> "--Huh? What does that mean?"
<2459> \{[Mari]}
<2460> "Umm... then, Rei-sama,
<2461> \ Come as close to me as you can,
<2462> \ Close your eyes."
<2463> \{[Mari]}
<2464> "The power of the Angel that is filled in the vessel that is me,
<2465> \ I'll pour it into you..."
<2466> \{[Mari]}
<2467> "Excuse me..."
<2468> As she closed her eyes as instructed,
<2469> I feel the soft touch of warm human skin.
<2470> \{［伶］}
<2471> "Mari...?"
<2472> Marie's forehead was pressed against his own,
<2473> Rei realized this the next moment.
<2474> From where Marie touched,
<2475> Like opening a small sealed box, something inside meーmy sensesーopened up.
<2476> \{［伶］}
<2477> "--!"
<2478> From the opened place, towards Rei's inner self,
<2479> Something emitting a dazzling light slowly pours in.
<2480> A flood of sparkling sound, played by the shimmering waves of light,
<2481> The waves surged against Rei's chest.
<2482> And like water poured into a vessel,
<2483> The light fills the heart and overflows, resonating majestically.
<2484> Like a wind blowing across the earth,
<2485> As if enveloped in light pouring down from the heavens,
<2486> A vivid, cool, and difficult sensation fills my body.
<2487> Every inch of your body, even your fingertips,
<2488> A mysterious sensation fills me, as if I am immersed in the vibrations of light.
<2489> \{[Mari]}
<2490> "The power of the Angel that I possess,
<2491> \ I have definitely handed it over to Rei-sama...!"
<2492> In the midst of the swaying pure white light,
<2493> Marie's voice had a certain tone of satisfaction to it.
<2494> I suddenly come to my senses and open my eyes.
<2495> \{[Mari]}
<2496> "How do you like it, Rei-sama...?"
<2497> \{［伶］}
<2498> "...This is..."
<2499> Marie handed it to Rei,
<2500> I can truly feel the pulse of the living, breathing power of the Angel in my heart.
<2501> The feeling of power permeates every corner of me.
<2502> \{［伶］}
<2503> "Something... like a light,
<2504> \ It feels like my mind and body are being fulfilled..."
<2505> \{［伶］}
<2506> "So this is the power of an Angel..."
<2507> Suddenly, everything in this world,
<2508> Fragments of light - that is, the information that constitutes its existence,
<2509> I realized it was taking shape.
<2510> Rei has had this since she was a child,
<2511> Touching the fragments of light emitted by human thoughts,
<2512> The ability to read that information--
<2513> The power of the humble rei to touch the hearts of people,
<2514> The youth's power to unravel existence,
<2515> Essentially, they are the same thing.
<2516> Rei's powers only allow him to read a portion of the information.
<2517> The difference is that the young man's power has reached the stage of unraveling existence.
<2518> \{［伶］}
<2519> "I think I understand the true nature of the power of the Angels."
<2520> \{［伶］}
<2521> "The stage of manifestation is different,
<2522> \ My power, the power of the Black Wings, and the power that Marie showed,
<2523> \ They're all different aspects of the same power..."
<2524> \{［伶］}
<2525> "That is something I understand very well now.
<2526> \ Now I can wield the power of an Angel."
<2527> \{[Mari]}
<2528> "I see! That's good to hear...!"
<2529> \{［伶］}
<2530> "Mariye, this power you entrusted to me,
<2531> \ ...I'll use it."
<2532> \{[Mari]}
<2533> "Yes...!"
<2534> \{[Takami]}
<2535> "...I don't really understand,
<2536> \ I'm glad it seems to have worked out well.
<2537> \{[Mari]}
<2538> "--Ah! T-Takami-sama...!"
<2539> \{[Mari]}
<2540> "Um... I'm sorry, Takami-sama..."
<2541> \{[Mari]}
<2542> "The closer we can get to each other,
<2543> \ It was easy to convey my power to Rei-sama..."
<2544> \{[Mari]}
<2545> "...Are you angry?"
<2546> \{[Takami]}
<2547> "Nothing. I'm not angry."
<2548> \{[Takami]}
<2549> "In order for you to give your power to Rei,
<2550> \ I understand that it was unavoidable."
<2551> \{[Mari]}
<2552> "I, I see. That's good..."
<2553> \{[Takami]}
<2554> "Ah... that's right. I understand that very well.
<2555> \ I understand, but--"
<2556> \{[Takami]}
<2557> "--Let me hit you a little."
<2558> \{[Mari]}
<2559> "Huh?! So, first of all,
<2560> \ I refused, asking you not to get angry..."
<2561> \{[Mari]}
<2562> "Umm...Takami-sama."
<2563> \{[Mari]}
<2564> "As an apology, once this is all over,
<2565> \ Takami-sama's favorite dish,
<2566> \ I'll make anything you want!
<2567> \{[Takami]}
<2568> "Yeah, that's right... when everything is over,
<2569> \ It's nice to be treated by you."
<2570> \{[Takami]}
<2571> "The idea of everyone gathering together and enjoying the food you cooked is...
<2572> \ That's not a bad suggestion."
<2573> \{[Mari]}
<2574> "So, what's good?
<2575> \ Takami-sama, please come up with the menu...!"
<2576> \{[Takami]}
<2577> "That's true... I'll think about it."
<2578> \{［伶］}
<2579> "Now, about what we'll do next..."
<2580> \{［伶］}
<2581> "Mari, you go with Takami."
<2582> \{[Mari]}
<2583> "Eh...?! But,
<2584> \ Then Rei-sama will be left alone...!
<2585> \{［伶］}
<2586> "I think it's better if I'm alone here.
<2587> \ Now that you've lost your power, you have no way to oppose him."
<2588> \{［伶］}
<2589> "More importantly... with the strength you have left,
<2590> \ I want you to protect Takami."
<2591> \{[Mari]}
<2592> "--I understand! I'll be back soon.
<2593> \ Please, Rei-sama, be careful!
<2594> \{[Takami]}
<2595> "Rei, please hold on until we get back."
<2596> \{[Takami]}
<2597> "Don't get caught by that guy."
<2598> \{［伶］}
<2599> "It's okay. I'll hold out until you guys return."
<2600> \{［伶］}
<2601> "Be careful there too.
<2602> \ There may still be intruders lurking.
<2603> \{[Takami]}
<2604> "Ahhh...!
<2605> \ Rei, I'll be back soon, so wait for me!
<2606> We finally decided to meet in the entrance hall.
<2607> Rei and Takami and the others split into two groups.
<2608> To ensure that the young man's attention is drawn to Rei,
<2609> Rei waits there for the young man to arrive.
<2610> Shortly afterwards,
<2611> A young man appears at the end of the hallway.
<2612> \{[Nue]}
<2613> "Oh? ...What happened to the others?
<2614> \ I left you and ran away,
<2615> \ Or maybe you let them escape..."
<2616> \{[Nue]}
<2617> "Have you given up and become obedient to me?
<2618> \ Or are you still plotting something?"
<2619> \{［伶］}
<2620> "...I have no intention of obeying you."
<2621> \{[Nue]}
<2622> "So you still defy me?"
<2623> \{[Nue]}
<2624> "--That's fine.
<2625> \ If that's what you want, I'll be your partner."
<2626> \{[Nue]}
<2627> "I don't know how you plan to resist,
<2628> \ I won't go easy on you."
<2629> \{［伶］}
<2630> "......"
<2631> While waiting for the young man to slowly approach me,
<2632> Rei focuses her consciousness within herself.
<2633> The power of the Angel entrusted to me by Marie,
<2634> It is the same power as Rei's that saved Takami long ago.
<2635> That's why Rei can use it well.
<2636> \{［伶］}
<2637> (Remember - how to use your power.
<2638> \ Please give me the strength to fight him...)
<2639> Rei touches the floor with her right hand,
<2640> As the power flows, it rewrites the information of that being.
<2641> Following Rei's will, a part of the bed transformed,
<2642> It transformed into multiple spears and attacked the young man's feet.
<2643> \{[Nue]}
<2644> "What...?!"
<2645> The young man jumped back in a flash,
<2646> Avoid the attack at the last moment.
<2647> The Black Wings fluttered back and thrust their spears at the young man.
<2648> With a single swish of its wings, it transforms into light.
<2649> \{[Nue]}
<2650> "That power is the same as that of another Angel!
<2651> \ Why do you have that power..."
<2652> \{［伶］}
<2653> "I inherited Marie's powers. --To fight you."
<2654> \{[Nue]}
<2655> "So, you have the power of an Angel,
<2656> \ Did you get a little bit?"
<2657> \{[Nue]}
<2658> "But if you haven't awakened your true power,
<2659> \ You still can't beat me, you know?
<2660> \{［伶］}
<2661> "You won't know the results until you try."
<2662> \{[Nue]}
<2663> "...Then let me teach you a lesson.
<2664> \ The difference in strength between you and me is clear to your body.
<2665> \{[Nue]}
<2666> "With the power of my Black Wings...!"
<2667> The black wings on the young man's back flapped widely,
<2668> The battle begins.
<2669> As Rei stood up, she touched the wall on her right,
<2670> As Marie showed us,
<2671> He strung multiple layers of steel thorns around the opposing wall.
<2672> \{[Nue]}
<2673> "An obstacle of this magnitude, in front of my Black Wings,
<2674> \ It won't be a hindrance...!"
<2675> The Black Wings raise their song of destruction,
<2676> When the thorns come into contact with the power emitted by the wings, they emit a white flash.
<2677> Without waiting for the thorny barrier to be dispelled by the power of the wings,
<2678> I kick the floor and run down the hallway.
<2679> Sensing the young man following,
<2680> Rei headed towards the entrance hall.
<2681> Takami, holding the trump card,
<2682> Believing that he will return to Rei...
<2683> The power that Rei exudes and the power that the young man exudes,
<2684> The sounds of the two people's powers, which seem different yet overlap,
<2685> Interfere and create discord.
<2686> Creaking, crushing,
<2687> It cannot be heard by the human ear,
<2688> A sound emanating from the power of heresy.
<2689> Both sides were immobilized by the other's power.
<2690> However, the experience gained thus far determined the outcome of the fight.
<2691> To resist the overwhelming power of the Black Wings,
<2692> Rei has no choice but to muster all her strength to fight back.
<2693> The young man smiles ominously.
<2694> \{［伶］}
<2695> "Ugh...!"
<2696> Just before he sensed danger and tried to retreat,
<2697> For just a moment, the young man relaxed the power of his Black Wings.
<2698> When the resistance suddenly dropped and the balance of power was upset,
<2699> The young man's leg casually brushes Rei's leg away.
<2700> \{［伶］}
<2701> "......!"
<2702> A kick that doesn't seem to involve much hip force,
<2703> Sharp enough, powerful,
<2704> It attacks Rei at an unavoidable moment.
<2705> My body floated gently,
<2706> Before I knew it, my arm had been grabbed and was being pushed back with force.
<2707> I was thrown hard onto the floor on my back.
<2708> \{［伶］}
<2709> "Ugh..."
<2710> A body that cannot take a passive stance,
<2711> Unable to escape the impact of being slammed into the hard floor,
<2712> It will be a real blow.
<2713> I couldn't breathe because of the pain from hitting my back.
<2714> Rei gasps.
<2715> \{[Nue]}
<2716> "I'm sorry for being so rough with you.
<2717> \ Your powers were a bit of a problem..."
<2718> I was caught off guard, and the pain broke my concentration.
<2719> Unable to maintain power.
<2720> Meanwhile, the young man's fingers moved quickly and caught Rei's wrist,
<2721> Hold it firmly to the floor to prevent it from escaping.
<2722> Incredible strength born from the same physique,
<2723> He easily pins Rei down.
<2724> Even if the power of the Angels is equal,
<2725> If you are brought into a frontal grapple,
<2726> It's only natural that Rei is at a huge disadvantage.
<2727> \{[Nue]}
<2728> "Just like this, I want you to be mine,
<2729> \ It would be nice to experience the power of your Angel..."
<2730> \{［伶］}
<2731> "I will never belong to you..."
<2732> \{[Nue]}
<2733> "Don't talk like that,
<2734> \ Shall I teach your body--Rei?
<2735> \{［伶］}
<2736> "......"
<2737> The young man's fingers were around the collar of the immobile Rei's clothes,
<2738> And then, the moment I tried to pull it out...
<2739> \{[Takami]}
<2740> "Let go of Rei!"
<2741> A gunshot rang out, a bullet aimed at the young man.
<2742> It is drowned out by the power of the Black Wings.
<2743> \{[Nue]}
<2744> "...It's you. You're still at the mansion.
<2745> \ If you had just run away, I would have let you go."
<2746> \{[Takami]}
<2747> "I won't run away and leave Rei behind!
<2748> \ Now, get away from Rei."
<2749> \{[Nue]}
<2750> "You're such an eyesore...
<2751> \ He has no power, but he's got a lot of presence."
<2752> \{[Nue]}
<2753> "...If you're frustrated, don't just be bossy,
<2754> \ Why don't you try to stop me by force?"
<2755> \{[Nue]}
<2756> "If you can do that..."
<2757> \{[Takami]}
<2758> "Yes, if that's what you want, I'll do it...!"
<2759> \{［伶］}
<2760> "Takami...!"
<2761> \{[Takami]}
<2762> "...It's okay, Rei!"
<2763> \{[Takami]}
<2764> "Mari, now!"
<2765> \{[Mari]}
<2766> "Yes, Takami-sama...!"
<2767> At Takami's signal, we held our breath until then.
<2768> Marie, who had been hiding in the young man's blind spot, jumps out from behind something.
<2769> Marie holds the iron bar in one hand,
<2770> He throws it sharply towards the young man's chest, like a javelin.
<2771> The iron spear, thrown with deadly precision,
<2772> He slipped past Takami, maintaining his sharpness and momentum.
<2773> He cuts through the wind and approaches the young man.
<2774> \{[Nue]}
<2775> "Something like this won't break the power of the Black Wings!"
<2776> The young man sneered,
<2777> Its black wings flap, trying to block the spear.
<2778> But――
<2779> \{[Nue]}
<2780> "Wh... What...?!"
<2781> The barrier of power that surrounded the young man,
<2782> The spear breaks through with surprising ease.
<2783> And thenーthe spear,
<2784> He aimed right and pierced the young man's chest.
<2785> \{[Nue]}
<2786> "Ugh... ha..."
<2787> \{[Nue]}
<2788> "This is... stupid!
<2789> \ What on earth... is using my power...?!"
<2790> \{［伶］}
<2791> "...the stone that seals the power of the Angel,
<2792> \ I used it for the tip of a spear..."
<2793> Answering the astonished young man's questions,
<2794> Rei somehow manages to push up her aching body and stand up.
<2795> \{[Nue]}
<2796> "A stone that seals the power of an Angel?! Something like that...!"
<2797> \{[Nue]}
<2798> "Ugh... Ugh...!
<2799> \ Is this something left behind by Kujo Takahisa...?
<2800> \{[Takami]}
<2801> "Rei... quickly, use your power on him...!"
<2802> Takami shouted as he ran towards them, following the spear's path.
<2803> I endured the pain and reached out to touch the young man.
<2804> The young man staggers back.
<2805> \{[Nue]}
<2806> "I won't let something like this defeat me...!"
<2807> The young man's trembling fingers grasped the spear piercing his chest,
<2808> I pulled it out in one go.
<2809> \{[Nue]}
<2810> "Ugh...Ahhh...!"
<2811> \{［伶］}
<2812> "...!"
<2813> So that Marie, who has the power of an Angel, can use it,
<2814> The use of stone in the spear was a disaster.
<2815> Even if you can't touch the stone,
<2816> It was possible to grab the body of the spear, so the young man used all his strength to grab it.
<2817> I pulled the spear out of my body.
<2818> \{[Nue]}
<2819> "...You did it, guys."
<2820> He tried to pick up the spear that had fallen from the young man's hand,
<2821> Rei reached out her hand,
<2822> One step ahead, the young man presses the sole of his shoe down on the spear.
<2823> Next, as Rei was about to use his power,
<2824> The young man's kick lands.
<2825> \{［伶］}
<2826> "Ugh..."
<2827> The kick was well-controlled,
<2828> Unprepared for the attack,
<2829> That was enough to stop Rei's movements.
<2830> \{[Takami]}
<2831> "You have no right to do this to Rei...!"
<2832> \{[Nue]}
<2833> "When you are around, Rei's heart is confused.
<2834> \ You really are a nuisance."
<2835> \{[Nue]}
<2836> "...I'll have you disappear."
<2837> \{[Mari]}
<2838> "Takami-sama...!"
<2839> Marie throws her spear again, but
<2840> The attack, lacking the power of stone, is easily dodged.
<2841> The young man spread his black wings,
<2842> He approached Takami.
<2843> \{[Nue]}
<2844> "Now... it's over!"
<2845> The wings of ominousness fluttered wildly,
<2846> He attacks Takami to bring about his fate of destruction.
<2847> \{［伶］}
<2848> "Takami――――!!"
<2849> Takami certainly looked like he was trapped by the power of the Black Wings.
<2850> However――
<2851> \{[Nue]}
<2852> "--Can't you erase it?!"
<2853> \{[Nue]}
<2854> "My powers aren't working?!
<2855> \ You're supposed to be just a normal human being--"
<2856> \{[Nue]}
<2857> "--! Could it be that stone...?!"
<2858> \{[Nue]}
<2859> "The stone that seals the power,
<2860> \ So there were two of them...?!
<2861> \{[Takami]}
<2862> "That's right! It all started with breaking a single stone,
<2863> \ I divided it into two parts...!"
<2864> \{[Takami]}
<2865> "To ensure that I defeat you!"
<2866> The stone's power to seal away the Angels
<2867> Takami is in the power of the Black Wings,
<2868> I was protected from that power.
<2869> \{[Nue]}
<2870> "Ugh...!"
<2871> \{[Takami]}
<2872> "You... have realized the possibilities that human power brings.
<2873> \ I underestimated you too much..."
<2874> \{[Takami]}
<2875> "Even though you underestimated me,
<2876> \ I can do this much...!
<2877> \{[Nue]}
<2878> "What...?!"
<2879> Takami had the sealing stone hidden in his palm.
<2880> He pushes it into the hands of the young man he has caught.
<2881> \{[Nue]}
<2882> "What is this stone?
<2883> The power of the Black Wings is being... cancelled...!?
<2884> As the screams of shock tell us, the Black Wings are slowly
<2885> Its form faded awayーand it disappeared.
<2886> \{[Nue]}
<2887> "I-I can't let go... Why is this...?"
<2888> Unable to let go of the sealing stone that touched his palm,
<2889> The young man roars in rage.
<2890> \{[Takami]}
<2891> "Rei, not yet...!"
<2892> In response to Takami's shouts as he restrains the young man,
<2893> Now the young man was completely defenseless against attack.
<2894> Rei touches it with all her might.
<2895> With all the power that resides within Rei,
<2896> Grasp the root that governs the young man's existence!
<2897> \{[Nue]}
<2898> "Ugh... Ahh...!"
<2899> The young man's heart - his whole being,
<2900> That's when I grabbed it in my hands.
<2901> For a moment, all time stopped.
<2902> And thenーit resonates.
<2903> Only the unraveling of life is required,
<2904> Lived a short life,
<2905> The sound of the heart rang out by a proud and lonely angel.
<2906> "Why are humans so...
<2907> \ Shall we greedily seek the lives of our fellow man?
<2908> Just quietly - full of wonder,
<2909> The young man's heart asks:
<2910> "The first time I killed a human,
<2911> \ When I was thirteen--"
<2912> “The life I have grasped shines white,
<2913> \ It becomes just a flash of light and disappears.
<2914> “I command living beings to unravel like things,
<2915> \ The cruelty of these people - their ugliness
<2916> “Why do humans take the lives of other humans?
<2917> \ How can you so easily order it to be taken away?
<2918> "A being so foolish and so ugly,
<2919> \ Why is this world overflowing?
<2920> “And why… in the midst of all that ugliness,
<2921> \ He was deprived of his freedom,
<2922> \ Did I have to live――”
<2923> “Everything in the world,
<2924> \ If you are filled with foolishness and sadness--"
<2925> "Destroy it.
<2926> \ Erase everything without a trace.
<2927> "Erase everything."
<2928> Rei gently touched the small sound with her finger,
<2929> I scoop it up in my palm and stare at it quietly.
<2930> I can hear itーyour heart.
<2931> You are just like me.
<2932> You lived in darkness, unable to find anyone who could save your heart.
<2933> Another me.
<2934> There are days when I have had similar thoughts.
<2935> But there are things in the human world,
<2936> I learned that there was more to it than that.
<2937> And thenーI found it.
<2938> A being named Takami, who wishes to live together with humans in the human world.
<2939> I can't hate people.
<2940> How foolish, how narrow-minded,
<2941> No matter how much a creature rejects and rejects heresy,
<2942> But even so, I love people very much.
<2943> SoーI can't go with you.
<2944> I live here.
<2945> \{[Nue]}
<2946> "You're saying you'll stay?
<2947> \ All alone on this earth--"
<2948> \{[Nue]}
<2949> "You will be the only angel in this world.
<2950> \ Can you bear that loneliness, Rei--?"
<2951> You're not alone.
<2952> Because I have Takami.
<2953> \{[Nue]}
<2954> "He is... not an Angel."
<2955> That's fine,
<2956> Even if he is human.
<2957> I just want to be with you.
<2958> That's all.
<2959> I will live in this world.
<2960> With him.
<2961> ...with humans.
<2962> \{[Nue]}
<2963> "I see--"
<2964> \{[Nue]}
<2965> "I can't do it, but if you choose the path of coexistence,
<2966> \ That might be a good thing..."
<2967> The last shred of light that made up the young man
<2968> Disappear from this worldーin an instant.
<2969> \{[Nue]}
<2970> "There is nothing in this world that threatens your existence.
<2971> \ I'll take you all...
<2972> \{[Nue]}
<2973> "So, you should live here.
<2974> \ --Together with humans"
<2975> Smiling calmly,
<2976> Expressing his quiet thoughts, a wave of light erupts.
<2977> The Angel, whose causal relationship with the world has been broken,
<2978> Losing the power to remain in this dimension,
<2979> Cease to exist - return to light.
<2980> Everythingーdisappeared in the light.
<2981> ……………………
<2982> ………
<2983> ……
<2984> And thenーand then.
<2985> From the last time I sent that Angel away,
<2986> Just how much time has passed?
<2987> Before she knew it, Rei was no longer blocked by the heavy ceiling or thick walls.
<2988> High and far away,
<2989> I lay there, looking up at the celestial sphere that spread out in a circle.
<2990> Buried in the rubble, the sky I looked up at
<2991> From black to dark blue and then ultramarine,
<2992> The color of the skirt hem changes while still being sprinkled with a thin layer of starlight.
<2993> Just before dawn, through the deepest darkness,
<2994> The world was about to greet a clear white morning.
<2995> I brushed off the sand and gravel from my body and stood up.
<2996> The place where that old-fashioned white Western-style building was supposed to be,
<2997> It had become a well-ventilated ruin of rubble.
<2998> \ruby{Nue}={Nue}, a young man, unleashed this in his final moments,
<2999> A shockwave of thought spread out in concentric circles around the Black Wings.
<3000> It wiped out parts of the mansion, turning it into piles of rubble.
<3001> I knew the young man's heart,
<3002> There was no need for Rei to worry about Takami's whereabouts.
<3003> I looked around and, just as I expected,
<3004> Unharmed and unharmed,
<3005> Takami is curled up on the ground, asleep.
<3006> What the young man took with him was
<3007> Beings connected to the dark side of the world he belonged to.
<3008> Protecting Rei and the others from collapse,
<3009> All those sent around here to capture Rei,
<3010> The young man left with him.
<3011> \{［伶］}
<3012> "Takami...wake up."
<3013> A body that sleeps with comfortable breathing,
<3014> Gently rocking to wake you up gently.
<3015> \{[Takami]}
<3016> "...Hmm? Are you...Rei...?"
<3017> Takami looked up blankly and muttered sleepily,
<3018> Rei couldn't help but give a wry smile and whisper.
<3019> \{［伶］}
<3020> "Good morning, Takami.
<3021> \ He was sleeping comfortably,
<3022> \ How does it feel to wake up?
<3023> \{[Takami]}
<3024> "How are you feeling...? Yeah... not bad..."
<3025> \{[Takami]}
<3026> "It kind of reminds me of that time..."
<3027> \{［伶］}
<3028> "At that time?"
<3029> \{[Takami]}
<3030> "The sky is so high... Your hair shines through the light,
<3031> \ Just like the day we first met..."
<3032> \{[Takami]}
<3033> "Very..."
<3034> \{[Takami]}
<3035> "......"
<3036> \{[Takami]}
<3037> "Ah...! That's right, that guy!?"
<3038> Takami finally became aware of the situation he was in.
<3039> I come to my senses and quickly sit up.
<3040> \{［伶］}
<3041> "He has left this world.
<3042> \ I'll take along those who tried to capture me..."
<3043> \{[Takami]}
<3044> "I see... he's disappeared..."
<3045> \{[Takami]}
<3046> "Hey, Rei. If I wasn't here,
<3047> \ Did you follow him...?
<3048> \{［伶］}
<3049> "I wonder..."
<3050> \{[Takami]}
<3051> "Actually... a little bit,
<3052> \ Weren't you wondering if you wanted to follow me...?
<3053> \{[Takami]}
<3054> "Because he was just like you."
<3055> \{［伶］}
<3056> "...I have you. So I won't waver."
<3057> \{［伶］}
<3058> "And you'll be by my side, right?
<3059> \ Close enough to make me feel less alone.
<3060> \{[Takami]}
<3061> "Oh... Yeah! Of course...!"
<3062> \{[Takami]}
<3063> "Rei, I'll always be by your side...!
<3064> \ I won't let you be alone!"
<3065> \{［伶］}
<3066> "I believe in you..."
<3067> As the sky begins to lighten,
<3068> Rei stands shoulder to shoulder with Takami and looks at him with deep emotion.
<3069> Soonーthe sky cleared up brightly.
<3070> \{[Mari]}
<3071> "Rei-sama, Takami-sama...!
<3072> \ You two have woken up!
<3073> The voice sounded so happy and bouncy.
<3074> He called from behind.
<3075> \{[Takami]}
<3076> "Is that voice Marie...?"
<3077> When I turn around, he comes running towards me, waving his hand.
<3078> Marie and Nozomi were seen looking cheerful.
<3079> \{[Mari]}
<3080> "Rei-sama, Takami-sama, are you okay?
<3081> \ Are you injured or anything?
<3082> \{［伶］}
<3083> "Oh, I'm fine.
<3084> \ --Takami, how about you?"
<3085> \{[Takami]}
<3086> "Me too, I'm fine."
<3087> \{[Mari]}
<3088> "I see, that's good...!"
<3089> \{[Mari]}
<3090> "And now I've been able to repay Rei-sama for her kindness."
<3091> \{［伶］}
<3092> "Mari, what are you going to do now?"
<3093> \{[Mari]}
<3094> "Huh? Is it me...?"
<3095> \{[Mari]}
<3096> "That's right. As for what we'll do from now on,
<3097> \ I hadn't thought about it yet."
<3098> \{[Mari]}
<3099> "...Ah! Now that I think about it, Rei-sama said to me earlier,
<3100> \ You've been entrusted with Nozomi-san!
<3101> \{[Mari]}
<3102> "So, you're going to continue to follow that command,
<3103> \ What do you think?
<3104> \{[Mari]}
<3105> "Of course, this is only possible with the consent of Mr. Nozomi and Mr. Takami.
<3106> \ That is if you can get it..."
<3107> \{［伶］}
<3108> "Takami, is it okay if I entrust Nozomi to Marie?"
<3109> \{[Takami]}
<3110> "Yes. I was planning to leave it with someone I could trust, but
<3111> \ I don't mind if Marie takes it on."
<3112> \{［伶］}
<3113> "Nozomi, how about you?"
<3114> \{［desire］}
<3115> "Um, if I could join you, Marie-san,
<3116> \ I think it'll be a lot of fun..."
<3117> \{［伶］}
<3118> "...Are you sure that's okay?"
<3119> \{[Mari]}
<3120> "Yes...!"
<3121> \{［伶］}
<3122> "Mari..."
<3123> I ask for your hope
<3124> Is Marie coming with us?
<3125> \{［伶］}
<3126> "Then I'll leave Nozomi to you.
<3127> \ ...I'm counting on you."
<3128> \{[Mari]}
<3129> "Yes! Please rest assured and leave it to me!"
<3130> \{［伶］}
<3131> "...Are you coming with me?"
<3132> I sensed an indescribable feeling in Marie's eyes,
<3133> Before I knew it, Rei had said those words.
<3134> I was surprised when I told him, but at that moment,
<3135> Suddenly, Marie's expression brightened,
<3136> I'm sure the invitation wasn't misplaced.
<3137> \{[Mari]}
<3138> "Uh... but, I..."
<3139> \{［desire］}
<3140> "Mari-san, please don't worry about me."
<3141> \{［desire］}
<3142> "No sad fate awaits you,
<3143> \ Now I'm fine being alone!
<3144> \{［desire］}
<3145> "You've been really good to me.
<3146> \ Please let me repay your kindness.
<3147> \ Don't worry about me, just choose the path you truly desire."
<3148> \{[Mari]}
<3149> "Nozomi-san..."
<3150> \{［伶］}
<3151> "So, I'll ask you again.
<3152> \ Marie, would you like to come with us?"
<3153> \{[Mari]}
<3154> "Y-yes!
<3155> \ If it's somewhere Rei-sama goes,
<3156> \ I'll accompany you wherever you go!
<3157> \{［伶］}
<3158> "I see. Then come with us, Marie."
<3159> \{[Takami]}
<3160> "If that's what Rei wants, then I don't mind.
<3161> \ ...Will you come with me?
<3162> \{[Mari]}
<3163> "Yes, of course!
<3164> \ Thank you for your continued support.
<3165> \ Rei-sama, Takami-sama...!"
<3166> \{［伶］}
<3167> "Oh, nice to meet you, Marie."
<3168> \{[Mari]}
<3169> "Yes...!"
<3170> \{［伶］}
<3171> "Then I'll leave Nozomi to you.
<3172> \ ...I'm counting on you."
<3173> \{[Mari]}
<3174> "Yes! Please rest assured and leave it to me!"
<3175> \{[Takami]}
<3176> "Well then, I guess it's time to get going."
<3177> \{［伶］}
<3178> "--! Wait a moment, Takami.
<3179> \ Because it's no longer needed,
<3180> \ Could you please remove Nozomi's collar?
<3181> \{［伶］}
<3182> "Otherwise, Nozomi's collar will activate..."
<3183> \{［伶］}
<3184> "...Wait a moment. Nozomi is now...
<3185> \ You and Marie came back from outside the mansion, right?
<3186> \ From such a distance."
<3187> \{［伶］}
<3188> "That position must be outside the collar's safe zone.
<3189> \ ...Did the device not work?
<3190> \{[Takami]}
<3191> "Ah, that story."
<3192> \{[Takami]}
<3193> "Well, actually... that's a lie."
<3194> \{［伶］}
<3195> "...Are you kidding me?"
<3196> \{[Takami]}
<3197> "Don't take Nozomi and run away from the mansion.
<3198> \ I lied to you."
<3199> \{[Takami]}
<3200> "Such cruelty,
<3201> \ There's no way they'd really let you wear it, right?
<3202> \ It's a bluff, a bluff."
<3203> \{[Takami]}
<3204> "The thing attached to the collar is just a transmitter."
<3205> \{［伶］}
<3206> "...I was completely fooled.
<3207> \ I never thought the day would come when I would be fooled by your lies."
<3208> \{[Takami]}
<3209> "Are you angry...?"
<3210> \{［伶］}
<3211> "No, I'm not angry. -- I'm glad it was a lie."
<3212> \{［伶］}
<3213> "In any case, we don't need it anymore.
<3214> \ Please remove it."
<3215> \{[Takami]}
<3216> "That's true, that's true.
<3217> \ The reason why I keep making him wear such a thing is
<3218> \ It was long gone..."
<3219> \{[Takami]}
<3220> "Nozomi, come here. I'll take off your collar."
<3221> \{［desire］}
<3222> "Ah, yes...!"
<3223> I rushed over to Takami and grabbed Nozomi's collar.
<3224> Takami easily unlocks the door with the electronic key he took out.
<3225> The necklace that had been around Nozomi's neck since they first met.
<3226> The symbol of submission finally disappears.
<3227> \{[Takami]}
<3228> "...I'm sorry. Even though it's a rule from my father's generation,
<3229> \ They forced me to do this and made things difficult for me."
<3230> \{［desire］}
<3231> "No... it's fine."
<3232> \{［desire］}
<3233> "Thank you for freeing me!
<3234> \ I... I'm grateful to you."
<3235> \{[Takami]}
<3236> "You... will forgive me..."
<3237> \{［伶］}
<3238> "So now... it's really all over."
<3239> \{［伶］}
<3240> "Of course, there are things that need to be done.
<3241> \ It's just a mountain left..."
<3242> \{［伶］}
<3243> "For now... we're free."
<3244> \{[Takami]}
<3245> "That's true..."
<3246> \{［伶］}
<3247> "Come with me, Takami. I'll help you too.
<3248> \ Alwaysーby your side.”
<3249> \{[Takami]}
<3250> "Ahh...! Well then, let's get going!
<3251> \ Let's go, Rei."
<3252> She turned to Rei with a dazzling smile that seemed a little embarrassed,
<3253> I took Takami's outstretched hand,
<3254> Rei and everyone else began walking towards a new future.
