#character '[Rei]'
#character '[Nozomi]'

<0000> Rei's relentless torture,
<0001> Finally, Nozomi lost consciousness and was placed on the bed.
<0002> Rei took a shower alone first.
<0003> After thoroughly washing away fatigue and sweat with lukewarm water,
<0004> Water drips from wet hair that has not yet dried.
<0005> I return to Nozomi with a sluggish, fatigued body.
<0006> In a lewd state with traces of rape left all over her body,
<0007> On the crumpled sheets,
<0008> Nozomi was unconscious, her arms and legs thrown out in exhaustion.
<0009> On your sleeping face, the traces of tears still lingering,
<0010> Rei saw a sadness that she could not hide.
<0011> \{[Rei]}
<0012> (...I guess that's only natural.)
<0013> As I gazed upon Nozomi's sleeping face, filled with fatigue and sadness,
<0014> Suddenly, I remembered Takami's words.
<0015> \{[Rei]}
<0016> (Ah, that reminds me, Takami,
<0017> \ I told you to always report back when you have hope.
<0018> \ Now, what should I do...?
<0019> Call
<0020> Don't call
<0021> \{[Rei]}
<0022> (It's a pain, but I'll try calling...)
<0023> After returning to her room, Rei orders the mansion staff to prepare the phone.
<0024> I called the cell phone number Takami had given me.
<0025> After a while of indifferent ringing,
<0026> The call suddenly stops, and a somewhat impatient voice answers.
<0027> When Rei told him about her wish,
<0028> Takami wondered if Rei had changed since she had hoped.
<0029> He questioned Rei relentlessly.
<0030> After all, I realized that nothing had changed.
<0031> He said he would come to pick up Nozomi first thing tomorrow morning.
<0032> After these final words, the phone was hung up.
<0033> Rei sighs and hangs up the receiver.
<0034> \{[Rei]}
<0035> (Will Nozomi be taken away from the mansion tomorrow?
<0036> \ To an unknown customer seeking hope--)
<0037> At last, the time has come.
<0038> I knew this moment would come eventually,
<0039> Rei is not yet prepared for today to be "that day."
<0040> But without any resolve,
<0041> Time has come mercilessly...
<0042> \{[Rei]}
<0043> (I knew this would happen eventually.
<0044> \ What's there to be upset about now...?
<0045> As if throwing away all doubts in your mind,
<0046> Rei closed her eyelids tightly.
<0047> \{[Rei]}
<0048> (...If I tell Takami that I embraced him,
<0049> \ My days with Nozomi may end here.)
<0050> \{[Rei]}
<0051> (No -- not yet. Just a little longer,
<0052> \ I don't want to give Nozomi to anyone like this.)
<0053> \{[Rei]}
<0054> (Yes... that child is mine.
<0055> \ I won't give it to anyone -- I don't want to give it to anyone)
<0056> \{[Rei]}
<0057> (Just a little more... Just a little more...)
<0058> I muttered this to myself as if praying,
<0059> As if trying to drive the dark reality from my sight,
<0060> Rei closed her eyelids tightly and firmly.
<0061> Farewell
<0062> Ever since Rei was invited by Takami and began living in this mansion,
<0063> How much time has passed?
<0064> My life with Nozomi has not yet come to an end.
<0065> Rei sexually disciplines the boy's body,
<0066> The days of indulging in debauchery continue to this day.
<0067> Without saying anything to Takami,
<0068> And Takami, without saying anything to Rei,
<0069> Days go on, supported by a precarious balance.
<0070> \{[Rei]}
<0071> (Yes - somewhere other than here,
<0072> \ Even if we try to find their fate outside of this mansion,
<0073> \ I know the reality of aimlessness.)
<0074> \{[Rei]}
<0075> (I don't want to let go of Nozomi... I want her to be mine alone.
<0076> \ But I can't take Nozomi out of the mansion.)
<0077> \{[Rei]}
<0078> (It was as if we had wandered into a strange maze,
<0079> \ Looks like a lost child――)
<0080> Unable to find an exit anywhere,
<0081> An endless dark maze,
<0082> It feels like Nozomi and I are just wandering around.
<0083> It's like I've slipped into a dream.
<0084> From this dead-end reality with nowhere to escape,
<0085> The two have no way to escape.
<0086> \{[Nozomi]}
<0087> "Hmm... ah... ha..."
<0088> \{[Rei]}
<0089> "Now, Nozomi. Today too, with this body of yours,
<0090> \ I'll have fun..."
<0091> \{[Nozomi]}
<0092> "Oh... please... forgive me..."
<0093> In stark contrast to her reluctance, she shed tears and her breathing became irregular.
<0094> While making the obedient boy's body drown in pleasure,
<0095> Rei was also drowning in the pleasure transmitted from her soft body.
