<0000> May 8th Marie Route
<0001> When I open my eyes, the morning sunlight pours in through the window.
<0002> It illuminates the surroundings dazzlingly.
<0003> \{[Rei]}
<0004> (...I feel like I was dreaming.)
<0005> \{[Rei]}
<0006> (…………)
<0007> \{[Rei]}
<0008> (I can't remember...)
<0009> For the past few days, whenever Rei wakes up,
<0010> All that remains is the sensation of having had a strange dream,
<0011> I can't remember the contents of my dreams.
<0012> \{[Rei]}
<0013> (...It felt like something was calling me...)
<0014> \{[Rei]}
<0015> (…………Well, okay.)
<0016> Rei stopped thinking any further.
<0017> I got out of bed and changed, just like always.
<0018> Head to the dining hall.
<0019> In a comfortable dining room bathed in bright, refreshing sunlight,
<0020> Focusing on Rei's favorite ingredients,
<0021> Enjoy a well-balanced menu of meals.
<0022> Marie's attentive time,
<0023> Until the very last moment of emptying the cup of tea served after the meal,
<0024> Enjoy to your heart's content.
<0025> \{[Mari]}
<0026> "Rei-sama, what are your plans for today?"
<0027> \{[Rei]}
<0028> "Today's plans -- well, what should I do?"
<0029> After thinking for a while, I answer Marie.
<0030> \{[Rei]}
<0031> "I walked a lot outside last night,
<0032> \ I'll just stay inside the building today.
<0033> \{[Mari]}
<0034> "Yes. Understood!
<0035> \ I'm working outside in the garden today,
<0036> \ Please call me anytime if you need anything.
<0037> \{[Rei]}
<0038> "Yeah... I get it."
<0039> That afternoon, Rei followed her newly discovered interest and
<0040> I spent my time reading old books.
<0041> As I was doing this, I suddenly noticed a table at the very end of the room.
<0042> On the wooden frame of the long, narrow bookshelf,
<0043> I noticed something like a slight gap.
<0044> \{[Rei]}
<0045> (…………What?)
<0046> Curious, Rei slowly pushes the bookshelf.
<0047> Then, the shelf rotates in the direction you pushed it,
<0048> Behind it - a bookshelf appeared.
<0049> \{[Rei]}
<0050> (This is... a revolving bookshelf.
<0051> \ I never thought there would be books on the back of the shelves.)
<0052> Driven by curiosity, I chose from the newly discovered books,
<0053> He took out a particularly thick book, revealing a beautiful spine.
<0054> \{[Rei]}
<0055> (This is...)
<0056> What Rei picked up was,
<0057> It looked like an old family photo album.
<0058> It seems that
<0059> This appears to be a family photo of the former owner of this mansion.
<0060> The fact that it is so ancient
<0061> What remains in the yellowed photograph,
<0062> You can tell by looking at the people's clothing and the scenery of the mansion.
<0063> Looking at the inside cover,
<0064> There was the signature of the mansion's owner.
<0065> As befits the owner of this mansion,
<0066> The signature was written in cursive alphabet.
<0067> \{[Rei]}
<0068> ("MIYASHIRO" - is this the owner?)
<0069> Commemorative family photos were taken in various places around the mansion.
<0070> As she turns the pages, Rei comes across a certain photo,
<0071> He stopped moving his hand in shock.
<0072> \{[Rei]}
<0073> "Is this... Marie?!"
<0074> What was there was,
<0075> Smiling in front of the broom bush,
<0076> A photo of a girl――
<0077> Framed by long, wavy hair,
<0078> A fragile smile like a Western doll.
<0079> The figure of a girl could only be Marie.
<0080> Rei hastily opens an earlier page.
<0081> There is a record of a girl's growth,
<0082> They are classified by year and kept.
<0083> Starting at around age three and continuing until around age eighteen.
<0084> Facial features, expressions, gestures,
<0085> All of them are photos of a girl who looks just like Marie...
<0086> The moment I saw that last leaf, which captured the girl's growth,
<0087> For some reason, my chest feels cold.
<0088> \{[Rei]}
<0089> (…………?)
<0090> I wondered where this strange feeling I had come from.
<0091> I take a closer look at the photo.
<0092> I lay on my back on the bed,
<0093> A photo of a girl with her eyes closed and her arms folded over her chest.
<0094> He looks a little thinner than in previous photos.
<0095> Her originally pale cheeks,
<0096> The girl's face looks as if it has become porcelain itself.
<0097> At first I thought the girl was asleep,
<0098> For that, it seems somehow too quiet.
<0099> If you look closely, you will see some text written next to the photo.
<0100> --April 30, 1941,
<0101> \ Miyashiro Marie died of illness at age 18
<0102> \{[Rei]}
<0103> (What's this...?!)
<0104> The ink in the handwriting is old, and the photograph also shows its age.
<0105> It is unlikely that this was fabricated recently.
<0106> \{[Rei]}
<0107> (...What does that mean?)
<0108> It looks so similar to the person in question,
<0109> He passed away many decades ago,
<0110> A photo of a girl with the exact same first and last name as Marie.
<0111> To insist that it is a false resemblance or a coincidental resemblance,
<0112> The two Marie are so
<0113> Their appearances - even their names - are too similar.
<0114> Could this be a coincidence?
<0115> This mysterious coincidence of signs,
<0116> For the first time, Rei begins to have doubts about Marie.
<0117> Call Marie
<0118> Leave the mansion
<0119> \{[Rei]}
<0120> (...I'll call Marie tonight,
<0121> \ Let's ask him directly about the situation.)
<0122> \{[Rei]}
<0123> (You can't make a good decision without talking to the person in question.)
<0124> Having made this decision, Rei then took the mysterious album,
<0125> It closed quietly.
<0126> \{[Rei]}
<0127> "Earlier, you said that the thing called 'Shadow' is aiming for is,
<0128> \ I said it was just me, right?
<0129> \{[Mari]}
<0130> "Yes..."
<0131> \{[Rei]}
<0132> "If I leave this mansion now,
<0133> The vision you saw will never come true."
<0134> \{[Rei]}
<0135> "I myself may be pursued.
<0136> \ But the people in this mansion,
<0137> \ It should be possible to avoid being caught in the crossfire.
<0138> \{[Mari]}
<0139> "Yes, that's certainly true..."
<0140> \{[Rei]}
<0141> "I think it's worth a try.
<0142> \ Staying in the mansion,
<0143> \ I don't think it's going to be a favorable situation for us."
<0144> \{[Rei]}
<0145> "Mariie, you were born and raised in this mansion, weren't you?"
<0146> \{[Rei]}
<0147> "Then, there's a path leading outside this mansion.
<0148> \ Do you know if there is some kind of underground passage?
<0149> \{[Mari]}
<0150> "Yes, there is. Regarding that,
<0151> \ I checked it while I was living in the mansion.
<0152> \{[Mari]}
<0153> "There is a passageway that leads from the old warehouse to the south side of the mansion.
<0154> \ Because it's an inconspicuous place,
<0155> \ No one knows there's a door there."
<0156> \{[Mari]}
<0157> "It has been left untouched for a long time,
<0158> \ It's very old,
<0159> \ The place is still passable enough.
<0160> \{[Rei]}
<0161> "Right... then let's head there right now.
<0162> \ Listen, Marie?
<0163> \{[Mari]}
<0164> "Yes...! Understood."
<0165> The place Marie took me to――
<0166> It's certainly not a place where people would enter,
<0167> It was an old warehouse.
<0168> Dust has accumulated on the ground,
<0169> There's no sign of anyone entering recently.
<0170> \{[Mari]}
<0171> "The door is this way."
<0172> Marie removed the piece of wood leaning against the wall,
<0173> There was indeed an old sliding door there.
<0174> \{[Mari]}
<0175> "This passage is owned by a \ruby{dandy}={dandy} grandfather,
<0176> \ Apparently it was made for fun..."
<0177> \{[Mari]}
<0178> "Before I was born, it was burned in a fire,
<0179> \ There is no trace of it now,
<0180> \ Long ago, there was a small hermitage in the annex of the mansion.
<0181> \{[Mari]}
<0182> "It seems that this passage once led to the hermitage."
<0183> \{[Mari]}
<0184> "The hermitage no longer exists, but fortunately,
<0185> \ Even now, this passage leads to the site of the hermitage.
<0186> \{[Mari]}
<0187> "When I was little, I used to play hide-and-seek in the warehouse.
<0188> \ I just happened to find this."
<0189> \{[Mari]}
<0190> "So, this passage is open to everyone except me.
<0191> \ No one should know it exists.
<0192> \ There's so much dust piled up..."
<0193> \{[Rei]}
<0194> "I see... so it's surprisingly easy.
<0195> \ Maybe we can get out of the mansion."
<0196> \{[Mari]}
<0197> "I hope so..."
<0198> \{[Rei]}
<0199> "Then let's go."
<0200> \{[Mari]}
<0201> "Yes!"
<0202> Rei and Marie took the light they had prepared,
<0203> I passed through the entrance to the underground passage.
<0204> The hallway was surprisingly spacious.
<0205> It was large enough that you could walk around normally.
<0206> Other than a slight moldy smell, the air isn't particularly stale.
<0207> Watch your step,
<0208> Rei followed behind Marie.
<0209> \{[Mari]}
<0210> "We'll walk for a while,
<0211> \ It's not that far."
<0212> With that, Marie carefully took a step forward.
<0213> --As we silently walked through the darkness,
<0214> Gradually, a mysterious feeling begins to emerge in Rei's heart.
<0215> There was one thing that bothered Rei.
<0216> I was watching it every day,
<0217> It was a dream.
<0218> In that dream, Rei heard certain words at the end.
<0219> \{[? ? ]}
<0220> "When you - - -, you - - -"
<0221> \{[Rei]}
<0222> (--What did that voice in my dream say to me at the end?
<0223> \ I can't remember clearly...)
<0224> \{[Rei]}
<0225> (The dream I had and the "shadow" that Marie spoke of,
<0226> \ Between these two,
<0227> \ I can't help but think there's some connection...)
<0228> \{[Rei]}
<0229> (...Am I overthinking it...?)
<0230> While I was thinking about this,
<0231> Rei heard the footsteps of Marie running ahead of her.
<0232> \{[Mari]}
<0233> "Rei-sama, here's the exit...!"
<0234> A rusty sound echoes,
<0235> Marie opened the door she saw at the end of the hallway.
<0236> At that moment, in Rei's mind,
<0237> The words spoken in the dream come back to me vividly.
<0238> \{[? ]}
<0239> "When you were about to leave the mansion--"
<0240> \{[? ]}
<0241> "The moment you go through the exit door, you--"
<0242> \{[? ]}
<0243> "--Enter my domain."
<0244> The moment those words became clearly conscious in Rei's mind,
<0245> I felt a sudden distortion in space.
<0246> \{[Mari]}
<0247> "Rei-sama? Rei-sama...!!"
<0248> Marie's voice echoed in the distance,
<0249> Gradually――――
<0250> Everything is gone.
<0251> The feeling of falling into darkness.
<0252> In my hazy consciousness,
<0253> Rei feels many fragments of thoughts that don't make sense.
<0254> "If R does not contact N,
<0255> \ --Let's try the second experiment.
<0256> "If we succeed in injecting R with the new drug,
<0257> \ It can erode R from the inside.
<0258> "It's a sure and safe method--"
<0259> "New drug makes it easier for two individuals to synchronize."
<0260> "You should be able to absorb R without physical contact.
<0261> Then all of R's power will become his.
<0262> "R will never wake up from his deep sleep--"
<0263> All those pieces,
<0264> A flash of light passes through Rei's heart for an instant.
<0265> \{[Rei]}
<0266> (――――What is this……?)
<0267> \{[Rei]}
<0268> (A fragment of someone's memory?)
<0269> Numbness in the core of the head,
<0270> Without being able to think deeply about its meaning,
<0271> Rei sank further into the depths of darkness.
<0272> \{[Rei]}
<0273> (...Where am I...?)
<0274> \{[Rei]}
<0275> (Why am I in a place like this...?)
<0276> Looking out, there is an endless wilderness.
<0277> The desolate ground where not a single plant grows,
<0278> Covered with dry soil.
<0279> \{[Rei]}
<0280> (…………?)
<0281> Upon closer inspection, Rei had injuries on her body.
<0282> There is more than one.
<0283> Rei's whole body was covered with large and small scars.
<0284> All of them are constantly bleeding.
<0285> The wound remains open and shows no signs of closing.
<0286> And Rei, the wound,
<0287> All I can do is watch.
<0288> This constant dull feeling throughout my body,
<0289> Is it the pain caused by the wound?
<0290> \{[Rei]}
<0291> (…………)
<0292> \{[Rei]}
<0293> (Since when have I had so many scars...?)
<0294> \{[Rei]}
<0295> (I've been here forever...)
<0296> \{[Rei]}
<0297> (Are you going to stay here forever...?)
<0298> I tried to walk, but my body wouldn't move.
<0299> Rei's body seemed completely exhausted.
<0300> \{[Rei]}
<0301> (I was... so exhausted.)
<0302> \{[Rei]}
<0303> (I can't even move a single step...)
<0304> At that moment, a hushed voice rang out from behind Rei.
<0305> \{[? ]}
<0306> (...with such deep wounds,
<0307> \ But still, you want to move forward?
<0308> \{[Rei]}
<0309> (Who are you?)
<0310> \{[? ]}
<0311> (…………)
<0312> \{[? ]}
<0313> (I know your pain...)
<0314> \{[? ]}
<0315> (I've been feeling the same pain for a long time now...)
<0316> \{[? ]}
<0317> (So I'm like another version of you.)
<0318> \{[? ]}
<0319> (I am constantly pursuing you from behind...)
<0320> \{[Shadow]}
<0321> (...In other words, a shadow.)
<0322> \{[Rei]}
<0323> (Shadow...?)
<0324> \{[Shadow]}
<0325> (Where else do you plan to go...?)
<0326> \{[Shadow]}
<0327> (There's nowhere for you to go...)
<0328> \{[Shadow]}
<0329> (It's okay to end it now,
<0330> \ Do you really think so?
<0331> \{[Rei]}
<0332> (…………)
<0333> \{[Shadow]}
<0334> (Because---you, who are supposed to be very strong,
<0335> \ Now I'm so fragile and weak...
<0336> \{[Shadow]}
<0337> (You must have reached your limit a long time ago...)
<0338> \{[Shadow]}
<0339> (There's no need to walk any further.)
<0340> \{[Shadow]}
<0341> (There's no need to associate with humans.)
<0342> \{[Shadow]}
<0343> (Come with me, Rei...)
<0344> \{[Shadow]}
<0345> (Let's "untangle" this wasteland and return it to nothingness.)
<0346> \{[Shadow]}
<0347> (You don't need to think about anything, just follow my instructions.)
<0348> \{[Shadow]}
<0349> (If you do that, you can go to the other world.)
<0350> \{[Shadow]}
<0351> (That darkness is kind to you--)
<0352> \{[Shadow]}
<0353> (There's no need to think about anything anymore.)
<0354> \{[Rei]}
<0355> (…………)
<0356> The dark whispers,
<0357> It slowly eats away at Rei's heart.
<0358> \{[Rei]}
<0359> (Maybe it's time to end it now.)
<0360> \{[Rei]}
<0361> (If the world ends and this pain ends,
<0362> \ Maybe that's fine.)
<0363> Rei looked behind her, towards the direction the shadow was calling her.
<0364> --At that moment.
<0365> Suddenly, I felt a familiar wind――――
<0366> Rei felt the wind carrying the scent of flowers brush against her cheeks.
<0367> \{[Rei]}
<0368> (Mari...?)
<0369> Close your eyes
<0370> Just turn around
<0371> Don't turn towards the shadows,
<0372> I thought I heard Marie's voice calling out to me,
<0373> Rei then turned around.
<0374> \{[Rei]}
<0375> (These are... black wings!?)
<0376> Covering the entire field of vision,
<0377> I thought I saw black wings spreading out.
<0378> The sound of the black wings and Rei's heart were now perfectly synchronized.
<0379> And so, the shadow finally captured Rei's heart,
<0380> Endless darkness spreads.
<0381> \{[Rei]}
<0382> (Darkness... darkness...)
<0383> \{[Rei]}
<0384> (...everything...)
<0385> \{[Rei]}
<0386> (Wrap it up…)
<0387> --And then.
<0388> Rei's heart was swallowed up by darkness.
<0389> \{[Rei]}
<0390> (... Creepy.
<0391> I don't feel like staying in this mansion any longer...
<0392> When Rei returned to her room from the library,
<0393> I packed my bags and prepared to leave the mansion.
<0394> That night, Rei never met Marie,
<0395> I left the mansion in a hurry.
<0396> Without giving Takami time to contact me,
<0397> Rei borrows the mansion's car almost as if she had robbed it,
<0398> I sped down the night road and headed home.
<0399> By the time Rei left the mansion and returned home,
<0400> It was already past midnight.
<0401> The hands of the clock on the wall point to the morning of the next day.
<0402> Lighting a lamp in an empty house,
<0403> I threw myself onto the sofa and sat down,
<0404> Rei finally breathes a sigh of relief.
<0405> \{[Rei]}
<0406> (...I wonder what I should do next.)
