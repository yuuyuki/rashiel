<0000> May 2nd
<0001> Marie came to my room to call me, and when I arrived at the dining room,
<0002> There, a feast is being held for Rei alone,
<0003> A table was prepared for dinner.
<0004> \{［伶］}
<0005> "...For someone like me who doesn't need much food,
<0006> \ Such an elaborate dish,
<0007> \ You don't have to prepare it every time."
<0008> \{[Mari]}
<0009> "To give Rei-sama even a little bit of enjoyment,
<0010> \ We will provide as many items as possible,
<0011> \ I thought it would be best if you could choose from the options.
<0012> \{[Mari]}
<0013> "The reason for the increase in the number of items is
<0014> \ This is for the time I helped out in the kitchen.
<0015> \ So, don't worry about it.
<0016> \{[Mari]}
<0017> "I hope that my body can be of use to someone.
<0018> \ It's such a happy thing--"
<0019> \{［伶］}
<0020> "...You've changed.
<0021> \ It seems like you really mean it."
<0022> \{[Mari]}
<0023> "Now, Rei-sama, please tell us what you like.
<0024> \ I'll serve it on a plate.
<0025> Encouraged by Marie, who was serving happily,
<0026> I finish my lunch, having eaten a little more than usual.
<0027> As she poured hot coffee into Rei's cup,
<0028> Marie asked, tilting her head.
<0029> \{[Mari]}
<0030> "Well then, Rei-sama. This afternoon,
<0031> \ How do you plan to spend your time...?
<0032> Go to Nozomi's room
<0033> Take a walk around the mansion grounds
<0034> Go see Takami
<0035> Return to room
<0036> \{［伶］}
<0037> "That's right... I'll go see Nozomi."
<0038> \{[Mari]}
<0039> "Yes, I understand."
<0040> \{[Mari]}
<0041> "...Ah! Please wait!
<0042> \ Speaking of which, today was Nozomi's regular checkup day.
<0043> \ Sorry, I forgot to tell you."
<0044> \{［伶］}
<0045> "Regular check-up? Nozomi felt something somewhere in her body.
<0046> \ Is there something wrong with it?"
<0047> \{[Mari]}
<0048> "No. I don't eat much, so
<0049> \ I'm worried about your thin body.
<0050> \ Nozomi-san does not have any chronic illnesses.
<0051> \{[Mari]}
<0052> "For the purpose of preventing disease and maintaining health,
<0053> \ Apparently, checkups are scheduled to be conducted twice a week.
<0054> \ Nozomi-san's body is perfectly healthy."
<0055> \{[Mari]}
<0056> "Nozomi's afternoon schedule is,
<0057> \ I was assigned to a routine checkup.
<0058> \ I'm sorry..."
<0059> \{［伶］}
<0060> "Yeah...that's unfortunate."
<0061> \{［伶］}
<0062> "So, what should we do now...?"
<0063> Take a walk around the mansion grounds
<0064> Return to room
<0065> \{［伶］}
<0066> "That's right... the weather is nice today,
<0067> \ Let's take a walk around the mansion grounds."
<0068> \{[Mari]}
<0069> "I see. Well then, please enjoy your stay."
<0070> On a warm, sunny afternoon,
<0071> Rei took a leisurely stroll around the mansion grounds.
<0072> The gardens are well-maintained wherever you look,
<0073> The vivid green soothes Rei's eyes.
<0074> When Rei returned from her walk and stepped onto the terrace,
<0075> Marie comes into view arranging flowers in a vase.
<0076> Call out
<0077> Don't call out
<0078> \{［伶］}
<0079> "...You're very enthusiastic, Marie."
<0080> \{[Mari]}
<0081> "Ah, this is Rei-sama."
<0082> I looked and saw Marie in a big vase.
<0083> Colorful seasonal flowers are arranged.
<0084> Cut to an appropriate length with gardening shears,
<0085> From the flowers spread on the table,
<0086> A gentle fragrance is in the air.
<0087> \{［伶］}
<0088> "...You're quite skilled.
<0089> \ Perhaps the flowers in the vase in my room,
<0090> \ Is this something you prepared?"
<0091> \{[Mari]}
<0092> "Yes, that's right!
<0093> \ Choose from the flowers grown on the museum grounds,
<0094> \ I am the one who lives it.
<0095> \{[Mari]}
<0096> "When I told the head maid that I liked flowers,
<0097> \ I've been entrusted with this job."
<0098> Marie arranges the flowers with careful movements.
<0099> The elegantly arranged flowers,
<0100> Even after being placed in a vase, the flowers retain their freshness.
<0101> They are blooming beautifully.
<0102> \{［伶］}
<0103> "...The flowers in my room are like that,
<0104> \ For some reason, your flower arrangements look so lively.
<0105> \ Is there any trick to it?
<0106> \{[Mari]}
<0107> "Well... there are a lot of things,
<0108> \ What I am particularly careful about is,
<0109> \ Putting delicious water in a vase."
<0110> \{［伶］}
<0111> “…Water?”
<0112> \{[Mari]}
<0113> "Yes. It's the same with cooking,
<0114> \ Just by changing the water you use into delicious spring water,
<0115> \ It's quite different."
<0116> \{[Mari]}
<0117> "Tap water is not good,
<0118> \ I go to a nearby spring to draw water,
<0119> \ The taste is really mellow and delicious!
<0120> \{[Mari]}
<0121> "It seems that the flowers are happy when the water tastes good.
<0122> \ For a long time, it was truly lively,
<0123> \ It is a feast for our eyes."
<0124> \{［伶］}
<0125> "I see."
<0126> Looking at the scene before me,
<0127> Marie's words were strangely persuasive.
<0128> \{[Mari]}
<0129> "Flowers are nice."
<0130> \{[Mari]}
<0131> "Each one has their own personality and their own opinions,
<0132> \ Looking at it somehow makes me feel energized."
<0133> \{[Mari]}
<0134> "Um... sorry!
<0135> \ Isn't this kind of story boring?
<0136> Boring
<0137> It's not boring
<0138> \{［伶］}
<0139> "It's not exactly boring...
<0140> \ I'll be heading back to my room soon."
<0141> \{[Mari]}
<0142> "Yes, I understand.
<0143> \ I have fun talking with Rei-sama,
<0144> \ I end up talking too much..."
<0145> \{[Mari]}
<0146> "At dinner time again,
<0147> \ I'll take care of you."
<0148> With Marie seeing her off, Rei left the terrace.
<0149> \{［伶］}
<0150> "I don't particularly find it boring.
<0151> \ Your story is surprisingly interesting.
<0152> \{[Mari]}
<0153> "I have fun talking with Rei-sama,
<0154> \ I tend to talk too much..."
<0155> \{[Mari]}
<0156> "I'm glad to hear you say that, Rei-sama.
<0157> \ I'm so happy...!
<0158> \{[Mari]}
<0159> "Rei-sama, do you like flowers?"
<0160> \{［伶］}
<0161> "I wouldn't say I like it,
<0162> \ I don't hate it either.
<0163> \{[Mari]}
<0164> "I see... Actually, I too,
<0165> \ I didn't like it much back then."
<0166> \{[Mari]}
<0167> "In the past, I wasn't very healthy,
<0168> \ There was a period when I was bedridden for a long time..."
<0169> \{[Mari]}
<0170> "One day, I sent some wild flowers as a sympathy gift.
<0171> \ I once had someone pick them for me."
<0172> \{[Mari]}
<0173> "The flowers are wild,
<0174> \ They are irregular in shape and size,
<0175> \ It didn't look very good, but..."
<0176> \{[Mari]}
<0177> "Just having that flower by my pillow,
<0178> \ I felt strangely encouraged.
<0179> \{[Mari]}
<0180> "Since then... I've come to love flowers."
<0181> \{［伶］}
<0182> "......"
<0183> \{[Mari]}
<0184> "Looking at flowers gives me a mysterious feeling."
<0185> \{[Mari]}
<0186> "...flowers don't think about unnecessary things,
<0187> \ It simply blooms in full glory as it is alive, and then scatters away.
<0188> \{[Mari]}
<0189> "Such a noble thing that goes beyond human consideration,
<0190> \ I might be attracted to it."
<0191> \{［伶］}
<0192> "......"
<0193> \{［伶］}
<0194> "That's quite surprising. The reason you say you like flowers is...
<0195> \ "Because there's nothing extraneous"
<0196> \{［伶］}
<0197> "But that's a pretty interesting opinion."
<0198> \{[Mari]}
<0199> "I see! I'm glad to hear you say that.
<0200> \ I'm so happy...!
<0201> \{[Mari]}
<0202> "Flowers are not only beautiful, but also very powerful.
<0203> \ So as not to kill the words of such flowers,
<0204> \ I hope to arrange them with care."
<0205> \{［伶］}
<0206> "I see..."
<0207> \{［伶］}
<0208> "...Ah, I'll be heading back to my room soon."
<0209> \{[Mari]}
<0210> "Yes, I understand."
<0211> \{[Mari]}
<0212> "It was fun talking to you, Rei-sama!"
<0213> \{[Mari]}
<0214> "At dinner time again,
<0215> \ I'll take care of you."
<0216> With Marie seeing her off, Rei left the terrace.
<0217> I didn't feel like talking to Marie,
<0218> Rei left the place in silence.
<0219> \{［伶］}
<0220> "Yes, I'd like to check on Takami's mood,
<0221> \ I guess I'll go..."
<0222> As I continued walking along the road leading from the mansion without hurrying,
<0223> Eventually, the annex building we were looking for came into view.
<0224> I rang the doorbell and introduced myself to the person who answered.
<0225> A servant appeared at the gate to greet the guests,
<0226> Rei is led into a room.
<0227> The room I was led into was already quite messy,
<0228> Now it was even messier than before.
<0229> \{［伶］}
<0230> "This is... quite a mess."
<0231> \{[Takami]}
<0232> "...I was looking for something for a bit."
<0233> \{［伶］}
<0234> "...Oh? What a surprise.
<0235> \ There are some very nostalgic photos here.
<0236> \ This is a commemorative photo from my entrance ceremony.
<0237> My eyes landed on a photograph placed on top of a pile of books.
<0238> Rei picks it up and looks at it.
<0239> The photo was taken on the day Rei entered high school.
<0240> Rei, wearing a uniform that was a little too big for her,
<0241> Standing next to Takami, who was wearing the same uniform as his senior,
<0242> He was photographed standing in front of the dormitory with a straight face.
<0243> A person from the mansion who accompanied me to the entrance ceremony,
<0244> Since I had the chance, I forced the two of them to stand side by side and took a photo.
<0245> The two of them stood side by side, looking much younger and more innocent than they are now.
<0246> The photo somehow made me feel itchy.
<0247> \{［伶］}
<0248> "Why is this here...?"
<0249> \{[Takami]}
<0250> "...It's not mine.
<0251> \ The portion I received is kept at Kujo's residence.
<0252> \ This belongs to my father."
<0253> \{［伶］}
<0254> "That person's..."
<0255> \{[Takami]}
<0256> "...there are some later photos from when I was in boarding school."
<0257> \{［伶］}
<0258> "During boarding school, huh--"
<0259> Ever since I started living in the Kujo family mansion,
<0260> Rei and Takami were set to attend the same junior high school.
<0261> The junior high school that Takami and Rei attended was a private coeducational school.
<0262> Takami and I left the Kujo family mansion.
<0263> I continued to commute to school from home, being picked up and dropped off by car.
<0264> The year Rei graduated from junior high school,
<0265> Long before I started seriously thinking about going to college,
<0266> Takami's father and Rei's guardian,
<0267> The head of the Kujo family, Kujo Takahisa, had decided Rei's future path.
<0268> Rei has no freedom of choice.
<0269> A person who was abandoned by his parents and taken in by the mansion,
<0270> There is no way I can go against my guardian's wishes,
<0271> Also, since there is no reason to dare to disobey, I silently obey.
<0272> And so, as Takahisa ordered,
<0273> A little earlier, at the private boarding school for boys that Takami attends,
<0274> Rei was also pushed in late.
<0275> Takami and Rei were enrolled in
<0276> It is famous for being frequented by many sons of wealthy families.
<0277> A comprehensive education system from junior high to high school was loudly proclaimed.
<0278> A prestigious private boys' school with a promotion system.
<0279> Both Takami and Rei were transfer students from high school,
<0280> Takami Kujo, who had previously established himself as one of the top students on campus,
<0281> Rei entered the school as a very close friend,
<0282> From the beginning, Rei faced a lot of criticism.
<0283> I left the Kujo family and entered a boarding school.
<0284> Having finally escaped Takahisa's intimidating surveillance,
<0285> Rei was able to enjoy her freedom to her heart's content.
<0286> Rigid rules and penalties, the hassle of group life, etc.
<0287> There were some troublesome things,
<0288> Even so, I felt like I was being kept under Takahisa's control.
<0289> It was much more freeing than life at the mansion.
<0290> \{［伶］}
<0291> "That was a very fun place for me.
<0292> Now, when I think of memories related to that place,
<0293> \ All I have left are happy memories.
<0294> \{[Takami]}
<0295> "Oh dear... How carefree.
<0296> \ From students who are jealous of your talent,
<0297> \ I've been harassed a few times."
<0298> \{［伶］}
<0299> "I guess that happened.
<0300> \ Apparently I was a prominent student back then.
<0301> \ I wasn't really aware of it, but..."
<0302> \{[Takami]}
<0303> "You look like that,
<0304> \ That alone made me stand out from the crowd."
<0305> \{[Takami]}
<0306> "At first glance, I look like a foreigner with pale skin,
<0307> \ I was often mistaken for an international student."
<0308> \{[Takami]}
<0309> "But, Rei, the reason you stood out from the others was because
<0310> \ That's by no means the only reason.
<0311> \ There were a lot of problems with your actions!
<0312> \{[Takami]}
<0313> "You sometimes do things that willingly incur other people's wrath,
<0314> \ He did some stupid things,
<0315> \ Can't you even remember that now?
<0316> \{［伶］}
<0317> "...?"
<0318> \{[Takami]}
<0319> "...You're being so cold,
<0320> \ I once witnessed you reject a student who had a crush on you.
<0321> \ That's what caused the argument with you."
<0322> \{［伶］}
<0323> "...I wonder if that happened."
<0324> \{[Takami]}
<0325> "At that time, the person who was clinging to you out of admiration,
<0326> \ He cut me off in some pretty ruthless words.
<0327> \ Even though it wasn't my own problem, it was painful to watch--"
<0328> \{[Student]}
<0329> "--I don't want you to pester me anymore,
<0330> \ Why are you saying such cold things?
<0331> Takami's words made me think of someone whose face I can no longer remember.
<0332> Hysterical shrieks and
<0333> The feeling of the fingers digging their nails into Rei's arm,
<0334> It came back to me as a tiny fragment in the corner of my memory.
<0335> \{［伶］}
<0336> "Can you stop pretending to be a tragic heroine?
<0337> \ We're both not serious, right?
<0338> \{[Student]}
<0339> "I'm not serious,
<0340> \ How can you say such a thing!
<0341> \{［伶］}
<0342> "You can show it off to others and be proud of it.
<0343> \ Maybe you just wanted a pretty doll?
<0344> \--I know."
<0345> \{[Student]}
<0346> "Eh..."
<0347> \{［伶］}
<0348> "I'm beginning to get annoyed with your arrogance.
<0349> \ Don't ever come near me again.
<0350> \ ...Goodbye."
<0351> \{[Student]}
<0352> "Wait...!"
<0353> Now that you mention it, that was certainly the case.
<0354> But for Rei,
<0355> After that, he changed partners and repeated the same thing many times.
<0356> It's just one of those scenes of lamentation.
<0357> \{[Takami]}
<0358> "I told you back then,
<0359> \ Isn't that a bit harsh?
<0360> \{［伶］}
<0361> "...Why do you care about that?
<0362> \ No matter who I shake off or how I shake off them,
<0363> \ This has nothing to do with you."
<0364> \{[Takami]}
<0365> "--!"
<0366> \{［伶］}
<0367> "To someone I don't even know, just because of my good looks,
<0368> \ I'm amazed that you can get so excited,
<0369> \ I was always impressed by the people who confessed to me."
<0370> \{［伶］}
<0371> "They don't really like me.
<0372> \ Because I understand that very well,
<0373> \ I have no intention of returning any decent feelings to them either."
<0374> \{[Takami]}
<0375> "Butーyou just didn't notice,
<0376> \ Among those who were coldly rejected, were there any who were serious about them?
<0377> \ It would be rude to lump everything together."
<0378> \{[Takami]}
<0379> "If you were rejected so coldly from the start,
<0380> \ No one can get close to you."
<0381> \{[Takami]}
<0382> "In reaction to being brutally rejected,
<0383> \ The number of people who hate you and want to hurt you has increased,
<0384> \ Why don't you change your attitude a little!
<0385> \{［伶］}
<0386> "Takami..."
<0387> I don't want to hear a sermon
<0388> You're still the same caring person
<0389> \{［伶］}
<0390> "...You're still as nagging as ever.
<0391> \ I don't want to hear a lecture. It's unpleasant, I'm going home.
<0392> \{[Takami]}
<0393> "Hey, Rei...!?"
<0394> He stood up, clearly displeased, and ignored the voices calling out to him.
<0395> I left Takami's room straight away.
<0396> After returning to the mansion, Rei spent the time until night fell.
<0397> I spent the time engrossed in breaking down the books in my room.
<0398> \{［伶］}
<0399> "You're still as caring as ever, Takami.
<0400> \ When I heard it for the first time in a while,
<0401> \ It feels somehow nostalgic, and your sermon is fresh."
<0402> \{［伶］}
<0403> "And you're so strict,
<0404> \ You haven't changed a bit since you were the dorm leader."
<0405> \{[Takami]}
<0406> "It's not that I'm strict,
<0407> \ You're so careless...!
<0408> \{[Takami]}
<0409> "One incident after another,
<0410> \ Ever since you entered the school,
<0411> \ My troubles only increased!
<0412> \{［伶］}
<0413> "Now that I think about it, whenever there's some kind of trouble involving me,
<0414> \ You came running over with a pale face..."
<0415> \{［伶］}
<0416> "Even though you're the dorm leader, it must have been tough for you too.
<0417> \ I will try my best to fulfill the duties I have assumed.
<0418> \ I take my hat off to your sense of responsibility back then."
<0419> \{[Takami]}
<0420> "You've caused unnecessary trouble!
<0421> \ Try to cooperate a little, or feel sorry and repent,
<0422> \ Wouldn't it have been better to show a noble attitude?
<0423> \{［伶］}
<0424> "...any fuss, I thought,
<0425> \ I didn't cause this."
<0426> \{［伶］}
<0427> "I want to spend my time quietly,
<0428> \ They get all worked up and start messing around with each other.
<0429> \{[Takami]}
<0430> "...There are certainly aspects like that, but
<0431> \ As I thought, there are too many problems with your attitude.
<0432> \ Be a little more careful!
<0433> \{［伶］}
<0434> "I'll try to do that as much as I can."
<0435> \{[Takami]}
<0436> "...Since long ago, you have been in a relationship with people regardless of their gender.
<0437> \ He was popular with both men and women.
<0438> \ I'm sure that won't change even after you leave the mansion."
<0439> \{［伶］}
<0440> "Well, that's pretty much it.
<0441> \ I don't know if it's a good thing or not,
<0442> \ Even now, many people are attracted to my appearance.
<0443> \{[Takami]}
<0444> "...I'm going to make everyone hate me here and there,
<0445> \ If you're still doing it, stop it now.
<0446> \{[Takami]}
<0447> "I don't think there's a dorm leader who can protect you like back then.
<0448> \ Because you're not around..."
<0449> \{［伶］}
<0450> "...That's right. That's advice from the hard-working dorm director.
<0451> \ I'll just accept this quietly."
<0452> \{[Takami]}
<0453> "...Please do so."
<0454> \{［伶］}
<0455> "Ah... sorry. I stayed a little too long.
<0456> \ I somehow feel nostalgic for old stories,
<0457> \ I just missed the opportunity to wrap it up.
<0458> \{［伶］}
<0459> "I hope I'm not interfering with your work."
<0460> \{[Takami]}
<0461> "No, I don't mind.
<0462> Me too... it felt kind of nostalgic..."
<0463> \{[Takami]}
<0464> "...I thought I was too old to reminisce about the past,
<0465> \ I look back and say, "It brings back memories."
<0466> \ We've come a long way from those days--"
<0467> \{［伶］}
<0468> "That's true..."
<0469> \{[Takami]}
<0470> "......"
<0471> \{［伶］}
<0472> "......"
<0473> \{［伶］}
<0474> "It would be bad to stay any longer.
<0475> \ I'll be heading home soon."
<0476> \{[Takami]}
<0477> "...Ah, that's right..."
<0478> \{[Takami]}
<0479> "Hey, Rei!"
<0480> \{[Takami]}
<0481> "Well, if you're bored at the mansion,
<0482> \ You can come and talk here again..."
<0483> \{［伶］}
<0484> "!"
<0485> \{［伶］}
<0486> "Yeah, I'll think about it.
<0487> \ ……Thank you.”
<0488> \{[Takami]}
<0489> "--! That's not something worth thanking me for!
<0490> \ I said it on a whim!
<0491> \{［伶］}
<0492> "Okay, Headmaster. See you later."
<0493> \{[Takami]}
<0494> "Hey, hey, Rei--!"
<0495> Before Takami could blush and scream in panic,
<0496> Rei chuckled,
<0497> I quickly left Takami's room.
<0498> Continuing to walk along the gentle, green road,
<0499> After about fifteen minutes,
<0500> Rei had finally arrived in front of the annex she was aiming for.
<0501> I rang the old-fashioned doorbell attached to the gate,
<0502> Soon, a female servant's voice appears in response.
<0503> \{［伶］}
<0504> "Is Takami inside?"
<0505> \{[Servant]}
<0506> "Your master has gone out for a meeting with his coworkers.
<0507> \ He will be coming home late.
<0508> \{［伶］}
<0509> "...I see."
<0510> It was a worthwhile visit, but it ended in failure.
<0511> I didn't feel like exploring the surrounding area.
<0512> Rei decided to just go back to the mansion.
<0513> Rei left the annex and returned straight to the mansion.
<0514> For most of the time since noon,
<0515> I spent the time engrossed in reading the books piled up in my room.
<0516> \{［伶］}
<0517> "That's right... I think I'll head back to my room for today."
<0518> That day, Rei spent most of the time between lunch and dinner,
<0519> I spent the time engrossed in reading books.
<0520> While Rei was reading a book in her room,
<0521> Marie came in to tell us that dinner was ready.
<0522> \{[Mari]}
<0523> "Rei-sama, excuse me.
<0524> \ Dinner is ready in the dining room,
<0525> Would you like to have dinner?
<0526> \{［伶］}
<0527> "Okay. I'll have dinner."
<0528> I wondered when it had become that time.
<0529> Feeling a little surprised,
<0530> Rei puts the book she was reading face down on the desk and heads to the dining room.
<0531> \{[Mari]}
<0532> "Rei-sama, please take this seat!"
<0533> \{［伶］}
<0534> "Ahh..."
<0535> \{[Mari]}
<0536> "I heard that you get very tired after your regular checkup,
<0537> \ Tonight, with Nozomi-san,
<0538> \ I don't think we'll be able to have dinner together."
<0539> \{［伶］}
<0540> "I don't really mind that.
<0541> \ Anyway, could you pour me some soup?
<0542> \{[Mari]}
<0543> "Yes, I'm back! The chef has put his all into cooking this dish.
<0544> \ Please enjoy tonight to your heart's content."
<0545> \{［伶］}
<0546> "Which dish did you make?"
<0547> \{[Mari]}
<0548> "I made these meat pies and fish dishes,
<0549> \ The same goes for salad dressing.
<0550> \{［伶］}
<0551> "Then please serve me the rest of the food."
<0552> \{[Mari]}
<0553> "Rei-sama..."
<0554> \{［伶］}
<0555> "I was just kidding. Put some meat pie on your plate."
<0556> \{[Mari]}
<0557> "Yes!"
<0558> Thanks to Marie's enthusiastic recommendation,
<0559> It's true that we can't get much out of it, but
<0560> Even more so than when I was living alone,
<0561> I was eating much more.
<0562> I don't have much of a passion for food, so
<0563> Although it is somewhat \ruby{frustrating}={annoying},
<0564> With an insatiable curiosity, he searches for Rei's favorite seasonings and ingredients.
<0565> I'm impressed by Marie's hard work.
<0566> Thanks to this, Rei felt something she hadn't felt much before.
<0567> I feel like I have discovered a part of the joy of food.
<0568> \{［伶］}
<0569> (...I will leave this mansion someday,
<0570> \ If you continue to learn the joy of eating,
<0571> \ I don't think that's a good idea though...)
<0572> At that moment, a thought entered Rei's mind.
<0573> Marie scolded Rei with a serious expression.
<0574> The scene is resurrected.
<0575> \{[Mari]}
<0576> "I think Rei-sama should gain a bit more weight.
<0577> \ If you're this thin, your resistance to disease will be weakened!
<0578> \ Please, learn more about the joy of eating..."
<0579> It is clear that he truly cares about Rei.
<0580> Thinking back to that sincere gaze, a bitter smile escapes my face.
<0581> \{［伶］}
<0582> (Is that what it means to be a dedicated person?
<0583> \ To my temporary master,
<0584> \ I'm amazed that you can be so considerate...)
<0585> Even though everyone was annoyed,
<0586> Speaking words of genuine concern for the Master's physical condition and health is
<0587> Is this within the scope of a full-time maid's duties?
<0588> I can't judge whether Marie is particularly good as a maid,
<0589> For the work given,
<0590> Rei can tell that Marie is always serious.
<0591> \{［伶］}
<0592> (Either way, he was being considerate of my health.
<0593> \ It's not so bad...
<0594> \{［伶］}
<0595> (Well, never mind--)
<0596> I wondered if there was anything that would change my mood.
<0597> Rei looked around the room.
<0598> There are almost no personal belongings that Rei brought into the mansion,
<0599> What's in this room?
<0600> It's like a collection of books packed into the shelves of a bookshelf.
<0601> At that moment, Rei suddenly mentioned that she liked reading, and Nozomi replied,
<0602> From the books lined up on these shelves,
<0603> I remembered that I had been planning to choose a book to take with me.
<0604> Finding a book for Nozomi
<0605> I wouldn't do that
<0606> Rei has always avoided contact with people,
<0607> Now, for someone's joy,
<0608> I never thought the day would come when I would think about doing something on my own.
<0609> I never expected that.
<0610> But that's not so bad.
<0611> What kind of book should I choose for Nozomi?
<0612> Rei looks at the spines of the books lined up on the shelf and thinks deeply.
<0613> Research books and literature that are too specialized,
<0614> There are many difficult sentences in which technical terms are quoted without explanation.
<0615> For those who are not interested in that field,
<0616> Not only is it unenjoyable, it's even difficult to decipher.
<0617> When I think about books with easy content that anyone can understand,
<0618> The books on this shelf are quite limited.
<0619> I glanced over the shelves,
<0620> Those two books were the first things that caught my eye.
<0621> "Dictionary of Angels of the World"
<0622> "Angelic Traditions of the World with Illustrated Explanations"
<0623> \{［伶］}
<0624> "...Shall I go with this?"
<0625> After thinking about it for a while,
<0626> A book entitled "Dictionary of Angels of the World"
<0627> Rei took it from the bookshelf.
<0628> \{［伶］}
<0629> (Oh, it was a book full of text.
<0630> \ Now then... is this really okay?
<0631> I placed the book I had chosen on the desk,
<0632> I change my clothes and get into bed.
<0633> Soon a deep, dreamless sleep will come,
<0634> He lured Rei into the darkness.
<0635> \{［伶］}
<0636> "...Shall I go with this?"
<0637> After thinking about it for a while,
<0638> A book titled "Illustrated and Commentary on Angelic Traditions of the World"
<0639> Rei took it from the bookshelf.
<0640> \{［伶］}
<0641> (This book has lots of beautiful pictures,
<0642> Nozomi seems happy...)
<0643> I placed the book I had chosen on the desk,
<0644> I change my clothes and get into bed.
<0645> Soon a deep, dreamless sleep will come,
<0646> He lured Rei into the darkness.
<0647> Until now, Rei has lived her life avoiding contact with people.
<0648> Now, for someone else's joy,
<0649> The idea of taking the initiative to do something is
<0650> I felt terribly foolish.
<0651> \{［伶］}
<0652> "...that's ridiculous."
<0653> Originally, it was just a whimsical idea.
<0654> It wasn't a verbal promise, and there's no obligation to do so.
<0655> Rei convinced herself like that,
<0656> I looked away from the bookshelf, trying to forget about it.
<0657> I changed my clothes and got into bed,
<0658> Soon a deep, dreamless sleep will come,
<0659> He lured Rei into the darkness.
<0660> I thought about reading a book,
<0661> For some reason, I just can't find the energy to read tonight.
<0662> Rei looked away from the bookshelf,
<0663> I quickly changed my clothes and got into bed.
<0664> Soon a deep, dreamless sleep will come,
<0665> He lured Rei into the darkness.
