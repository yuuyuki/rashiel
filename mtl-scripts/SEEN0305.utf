<0000> May 9th Nozomi Route
<0001> The glorious morning light,
<0002> Regardless of the tragedies and comedies that unfold in the human world,
<0003> It falls on everyone without distinction.
<0004> Even if the scales of fate tip towards sadness,
<0005> Nothing changes in our daily lives.
<0006> Everyone living in the mansion,
<0007> As if unaware of the fate that awaits hope,
<0008> Acting out an ordinary everyday life.
<0009> Without showing even a hint of change,
<0010> Everyday life at the mansion passed by uneventfully.
<0011> The morning came just like any other, and soon it was noon.
<0012> And then, eventually, night comes.
<0013> From the moment I decided to "hand over" Nozomi to Takami,
<0014> Rei stopped seeing Nozomi.
<0015> Having decided their fate, Rei now has no words to say to Nozomi.
<0016> Even wanting to meet you was a deception.
<0017> I was so worried and concerned about Nozomi's future,
<0018> I didn't feel like meeting Marie,
<0019> I thoroughly avoided situations where we would have to exchange words and kept my distance.
<0020> Falling asleep, on the verge of dreaming.
<0021> That one - straight as a small animal living in the forest,
<0022> I thought of Nozomi's eyes quietly looking up at me,
<0023> I tried to forget everything and turn my attention away from the thought.
<0024> On the surface, as if there is nothing cruel in the world,
<0025> Naturally,
<0026> This morning, the peaceful daily routine is repeated at the mansion.
<0027> However, Rei already knew.
<0028> There are signs of an ominous storm that will take Nozomi away.
<0029> As we decided last night, even if it is just a small clue that will lead us closer to the secret,
<0030> Aiming to get it,
<0031> Rei left the mansion to sneak into Takami's room.
<0032> The gentle mountain path leading from the mansion
<0033> As Takami had instructed, after walking for about fifteen minutes,
<0034> The roofs of buildings appear beyond the rows of trees.
<0035> \{［伶］}
<0036> (Is that the annex where Takami is staying?)
<0037> Soon we arrived at our destination, in front of the annex.
<0038> It was used as one of the designs to decorate the gate.
<0039> When you ring the somewhat old-fashioned doorbell,
<0040> Soon, the dry voice of a female servant answers.
<0041> \{[Servant]}
<0042> "Who is this...?"
<0043> \{［伶］}
<0044> "This is Saiga, a relative of Takami.
<0045> \ ...I brought something for him."
<0046> \{[Servant]}
<0047> "I'm very sorry,
<0048> \ Master is out today.
<0049> \{[Servant]}
<0050> "It looks like he'll be back in the afternoon..."
<0051> \{［伶］}
<0052> "I see. Well, it would be a hassle to come back here again, so
<0053> \ Could you please look after my luggage?
<0054> \{[Servant]}
<0055> "Understood. Please wait a moment."
<0056> I waited as instructed, and soon,
<0057> A young woman dressed as a maid,
<0058> He pushed open the gate and appeared in front of Rei.
<0059> \{[Servant]}
<0060> "What luggage will you be entrusting to Master...?"
<0061> \{［伶］}
<0062> "Ah, this is it."
<0063> To give me an excuse to visit the mansion,
<0064> I picked out some random luggage and wrapped it up in my room.
<0065> Rei shows it to the maid.
<0066> The maid held out her hand to receive the package.
<0067> Rei placed it lightly in the palm of her hand,
<0068> He gave me a gentle, polite smile.
<0069> \{［伶］}
<0070> "How many people work in this mansion?
<0071> \ Knowing Takami, someone as cute as you,
<0072> \ I guess they employ a lot of people?
<0073> \{[Servant]}
<0074> "Ah..."
<0075> People who don't know Rei well are easily won over,
<0076> A smile that is well-liked but not sincere,
<0077> It appears this maid has also been subjugated.
<0078> Looking straight into my eyes,
<0079> Rei's friendly smile, directed only at her,
<0080> The maid blushes, as if enchanted.
<0081> \{[Servant]}
<0082> "No, no. The person working at this mansion is,
<0083> \ I'm alone..."
<0084> \{［伶］}
<0085> "You're the only one...?"
<0086> I focused my attention on the maid's hand that I had just touched,
<0087> Rei uses her power to touch hearts.
<0088> Immediately, Rei's vision lost all color.
<0089> Only the sparkling fragments of light emitted by human thoughts,
<0090> They flicker and twinkle, coloring the world.
<0091> \{［伶］}
<0092> "Oh, so you're going to have to cater to Takami's whims,
<0093> \ That must be really hard."
<0094> \{［伶］}
<0095> "Takami likes to be neat,
<0096> \ It doesn't seem like it would be easy to clean by yourself."
<0097> \{[Servant]}
<0098> "No, that's not true...!
<0099> \ This mansion has very few rooms,
<0100> \ It's not that hard."
<0101> \{［伶］}
<0102> "Yes - you're a capable maid."
<0103> \{[Servant]}
<0104> "Oh, no way..."
<0105> In order to extract the necessary information from the maid's mind,
<0106> Touching and confirming the fragments of her thoughts,
<0107> Continue the conversation lightly, just small talk.
<0108> To help the maid's thoughts focus on the information she needs,
<0109> Talk to them while skillfully guiding them,
<0110> Rei successfully obtained more detailed information than what was in the conversation.
<0111> \{［伶］}
<0112> (...Is that all?)
<0113> Seeing that it was time, Rei easily let go of the maid,
<0114> He steps back, still smiling politely.
<0115> \{［伶］}
<0116> "...Thank you.
<0117> \ Please give my best regards to Takami.
<0118> \{[Servant]}
<0119> "Ah... yes. I'll let you know."
<0120> \{[Servant]}
<0121> "Well, we have certainly received your luggage."
<0122> The maid blushed and looked dazed.
<0123> I bowed my head, casting a reluctant glance at Rei,
<0124> I watched Rei go until she was out of sight.
<0125> From the shade of the trees, I watched in the distance as the maid returned to the mansion.
<0126> Be careful not to be seen,
<0127> This time, we head back from the back to near Takami's Annex.
<0128> \{［伶］}
<0129> (From what I could tell from her, the simple security arrangement
<0130> \ Looks like I can get in without any trouble...)
<0131> \{［伶］}
<0132> (Even so, that's strange.
<0133> \ Immediately after using force, one often suffers from recoil,
<0134> \ Strangely, I'm not suffering today...)
<0135> \{［伶］}
<0136> (In fact, I've already used it once,
<0137> \ I still have plenty of strength left.
<0138> \ At this rate, I think I can use my power a few more times--)
<0139> \{［伶］}
<0140> (Reading the memories left in the object,
<0141> It seems that my power capacity has increased--)
<0142> \{［伶］}
<0143> (The cause of both of these is,
<0144> \ Is it because I'm by Nozomi's side...?)
<0145> \{［伶］}
<0146> (…………)
<0147> \{［伶］}
<0148> (There's no point in thinking about it now.
<0149> \ Let's hope we can get some information from Takami's room.)
<0150> Rei shook off her doubts and
<0151> I focused my attention solely on sneaking into Takami's room.
<0152> During the short time Takami was away,
<0153> Rei successfully entered the room,
<0154> First, take a look around you.
<0155> Stacked messily around the room,
<0156> Mountains of papers and files, likely work documents and materials.
<0157> Perhaps classified according to a unique order,
<0158> To the casual observer, it just looks like it's been shoved in haphazardly.
<0159> Books, documents, and files lined the bookshelves.
<0160> Takami's room was so chaotic,
<0161> Where on earth is something important hidden?
<0162> It's hard to imagine at first glance.
<0163> \{［伶］}
<0164> (This... doesn't seem like it'll be easy...)
<0165> Even if I use my newly acquired power,
<0166> Ability is not unlimited.
<0167> Items placed around the room,
<0168> If you pick them up one by one and explore them,
<0169> It's so much work that it takes up a lot of energy and time.
<0170> In order for Rei to use her powers effectively,
<0171> It seems that some narrowing down will be necessary.
<0172> \{［伶］}
<0173> (Right, first of all, Takami seems to have the most records,
<0174> \ Let's start with that laptop.
<0175> When you turn on the power and start up the laptop,
<0176> Authorize access to files,
<0177> First, I was asked to enter my password.
<0178> The password you enter every time you start the program is
<0179> Isn't it something that will easily remain in your memory?
<0180> Thinking this, Rei gently touched the keyboard,
<0181> It seems to have been left there strongly,
<0182> I tried to read fragments of memory.
<0183> \{［伶］}
<0184> (...This, huh...)
<0185> The light flickers and scatters,
<0186> In fragments of memory, most of which don't make any clear sense,
<0187> I found the information I was looking for.
<0188> \{［伶］}
<0189> (That's the password...)
<0190> After entering the password and the screen appears,
<0191> I wondered if there was any important information left there.
<0192> Check every suspicious file that catches your eye.
<0193> The file that seems to be related to Nozomi is
<0194> It's hard to find.
<0195> Perhaps the information Rei is looking for is in this
<0196> Perhaps there was nothing left to begin with.
<0197> Just when Rei was about to give up on her search,
<0198> Finally, I found some data that seemed to contain that information.
<0199> "Excerpt from the records of Takahisa Kujo,
<0200> \ Writing about the subject "Angel"
<0201> It was a compilation of documents left by Takami's father.
<0202> It looked like data.
<0203> A password was set to open the file,
<0204> That obstacle is no longer an obstacle for Rei now.
<0205> Rei easily reads the password from the remaining memories,
<0206> Open a locked file.
<0207> "R is a being that reflects the image of an angel."
<0208> Such a sentence appeared on the LCD screen,
<0209> It jumps into Rei's field of vision.
<0210> “Based on the blood of beings we call Angels,
<0211> \ With the same genetic composition as the original,
<0212> \ I secretly tried to create a perfect \ruby{duplicate}={clone}"
<0213> "And so—I met R,
<0214> \ A rare being has been obtained.
<0215> \ We, the artificial angels created by human hands.
<0216> The records left by Takahisa show that from the blood of the Angel he obtained,
<0217> They began an attempt to create a perfect replica of the Angel,
<0218> And then—it was written that Takahisa had succeeded in doing so.
<0219> As I continued reading the file,
<0220> Rei could feel her own complexion change.
<0221> “Until now, it has also served as camouflage,
<0222> \ R was entrusted to the family of the donor who became the mother.
<0223> “However, when the donor’s mind collapsed,
<0224> \ Although it was earlier than planned,
<0225> \ I have decided to take R to my Kujo residence.
<0226> “R is now twelve years old and has been taken in by the Kujo residence.
<0227> \ Outwardly, he looked no different from other boys his age.
<0228> \ He has yet to show any signs of demonstrating his angelic powers.
<0229> \{［伶］}
<0230> "......"
<0231> If you read that far,
<0232> Who does the "R" that appears in the record refer to?
<0233> Rei had already guessed it more than enough.
<0234> Takahisa poured his heart and soul into creating
<0235> Name withheld,
<0236> The mysterious existence of an "Angel's \ruby{Replica}={Clone}"
<0237> It was a fact that Rei found hard to believe,
<0238> When the description reaches this point,
<0239> It seems that everything is pointing to Rei.
<0240> \{［伶］}
<0241> (Are you saying I'm a clone of an angel?
<0242> \ No way...)
<0243> However, leaving behind Rei's wavering heart,
<0244> Takahisa's account, written in a calm and objective style, continues.
<0245> “Angels have special abilities that humans don’t have,
<0246> \ "It is prepared in the body."
<0247> “As a characteristic of the Angel’s abilities,
<0248> \ The most distinctive feature is
<0249> \ Resonance phenomenon of the power of the Angels――
<0250> “Two vibrating bodies with the same natural frequency are placed side by side,
<0251> \ When one of them is vibrated,
<0252> \ Resonating with another vibrating body begins.
<0253> “That is the resonance effect, but the same thing happens,
<0254> It seems to happen more often among those with angelic blood.
<0255> “Just as tuning forks amplify the vibrations they resonate between each other,
<0256> \ The power of the Angels also resonates with each other,
<0257> \ It seems that they tend to enhance each other's powers.
<0258> According to Takahisa's records, those with the blood of an Angel,
<0259> It is said that he has special abilities that humans do not have.
<0260> And the Angels resonate with each other's powers,
<0261> It seems possible to further increase your own power.
<0262> "If on the one hand there is someone who awakens to the power of the Angels,
<0263> \ The angels who have not yet awakened also resonate with that power,
<0264> \ There is a high possibility that it will awaken dormant powers.
<0265> “So, there is a possibility that this could be the catalyst for Rei’s awakening.
<0266> \ I propose creating another tool using Angel blood as a base.
<0267> Takahisa brings a being of the same Angel bloodline closer to Rei,
<0268> By creating a resonance phenomenon,
<0269> I thought about awakening Rei's Angelic powers.
<0270> And then—the result.
<0271> To awaken Rei to the power of an angel,
<0272> The prepared existence is hope,
<0273> Rei confirmed the description that seemed to suggest this.
<0274> "They created it by combining Angel genes with human genes,
<0275> \ An entity with abilities inferior to that of a pure Angel.
<0276> Children who are human but have the blood of angels in their veins――”
<0277> “From among them, we will select the most promising individual to become an Angel,
<0278> \ When the time comes, I will introduce you to the true Angel, R.
<0279> \ Decide to raise it specially
<0280> “Chosen for the Angel,
<0281> A special child with the blood of an Angel――
<0282> "I have a deep feeling for this boy,
<0283> \ Give the name N.
<0284> “N is a fake angel,
<0285> \ As someone of Angelic descent, he is a promising individual.
<0286> “To be able to resonate more with the hearts of the Angels,
<0287> \ As far away from the crowd as possible,
<0288> \ It may be necessary to raise it purely in nature.
<0289> “The Angel and the Catalyst, until their time comes,
<0290> \ N was raised in isolation in the forest prepared for him,
<0291> \ We will wait for a report on its progress.
<0292> He is called a child of angelic blood,
<0293> Nozomi tells Rei that she grew up in a deserted forest.
<0294> Nozomi's life story matches the description in this record.
<0295> So, after all,
<0296> A being named "N" who is of angelic blood and prepared for Rei,
<0297> There is no doubt that this refers to hope.
<0298> \{［伶］}
<0299> (... An Angel replica,
<0300> \ The catalyst to awaken the Angel...)
<0301> \{［伶］}
<0302> (All of this is hard to believe,
<0303> \ If the person who left the record was Kujo Takahisa,
<0304> \ This may be highly reliable information...)
<0305> \{［伶］}
<0306> (At least, Takami seems to believe this record.
<0307> \ The reason why he forced me to meet Nozomi was
<0308> \ Is it to draw out the power of the Angel that person desired?
<0309> \{［伶］}
<0310> (That means--)
<0311> \{［伶］}
<0312> (Nozomi is of Angelic descent,
<0313> \ He is not the angel his father wanted,
<0314> Takami already knew when he invited me to the mansion...
<0315> \{［伶］}
<0316> (So, regarding the plan that Nozomi heard in her sleep,
<0317> \ The possibility that Takami is involved is
<0318> \ Is that entirely possible?
<0319> \{［伶］}
<0320> (Of course, it's possible that they aren't allies,
<0321> \ There is plenty left, but...)
<0322> \{［伶］}
<0323> (…………)
<0324> The data that caught Rei's attention even more was,
<0325> It doesn't appear to have been left inside the laptop.
<0326> Rei erased as many traces of her access as possible,
<0327> Powered off.
<0328> \{［伶］}
<0329> (Now then, what should I research next?)
<0330> Items that Takami has touched for as long as possible and that he seems to have put a lot of thought into.
<0331> It is preferable to select it as an exploration target.
<0332> When we lived together in the same house,
<0333> Thinking back on Takami's habits, preferences, and tendencies,
<0334> Rei slowly looks around, thinking.
<0335> As I looked around the room,
<0336> Takami stayed in this annex not to relax,
<0337> I got the impression he was coming back to continue his work.
<0338> But why not a convenient office in town?
<0339> Will Takami go all the way back to the annex, which is in a remote location?
<0340> Is there some reason why it has to be here?
<0341> Thinking about it, I looked around,
<0342> This room is said to be furnished according to Takami's tastes.
<0343> There were a few things that felt a little strange.
<0344> The only painting hanging on the wall was a landscape in heavy tones.
<0345> I don't think this is a subject matter that Takami would particularly like.
<0346> The use of color and brushstrokes are different from what Takami has always preferred.
<0347> The contents of the books lined up on the bookshelf,
<0348> It's hard to say that these were collected as a hobby of Takami.
<0349> I see a few.
<0350> Takami had no qualms about reading books,
<0351> I was not a person who enjoyed reading widely.
<0352> For that reason alone, it is not surprising that books that are not of interest to me are lined up on the shelves.
<0353> This made Rei feel uneasy.
<0354> --So, what should we investigate in this room?
<0355> Examine the bookshelf
<0356> Examine the painting on the wall
<0357> Stop
<0358> Something strange caught Rei's eye.
<0359> Some books that are far removed from Takami's usual interests,
<0360> I gently pull it off the shelf and examine it.
<0361> I flipped through the pages to check,
<0362> There is nothing particularly suspicious or unusual about the book.
<0363> I picked up an old German book and opened it.
<0364> On the edge of a worn, yellowed page,
<0365> I found a scribble stained with blue fountain pen ink.
<0366> \{［伶］}
<0367> (This isn't Takami's writing.
<0368> \ This writing style is...)
<0369> \{［伶］}
<0370> (Takahisa Kujo...)
<0371> In other words, this book is not Takami's,
<0372> This must have been an item that Takahisa owned when he was alive.
<0373> Rei remembers the words Takami's father left behind.
<0374> I looked at it again carefully.
<0375> "Angels were attracted to humans and descended to earth.
<0376> \ What if those angels are still alive today?
<0377> \{［伶］}
<0378> (...I don't understand, what does that mean?)
<0379> Other than that scribble, nothing else unusual was found.
<0380> Rei gave up searching any further on the shelves.
<0381> The landscape painting on the wall is unlikely to have been chosen based on Takami's personal taste.
<0382> It caught Rei's attention.
<0383> The moment I concentrated and touched my outstretched fingers to the frame,
<0384> Information conveyed by the “light” reflected in Rei’s field of vision.
<0385> It means that someone had a strong emotional attachment to this painting.
<0386> The "fragment of memory" that shows this fact,
<0387> It turned out that he didn't have the color to refer to Takami.
<0388> \{［伶］}
<0389> (This is... a memory left behind by "that person"--)
<0390> It is a color that represents someone Rei knows well.
<0391> Takami's father and former guardian of Rei,
<0392> The late former head of the Kujo family, Takahisa Kujo,
<0393> Fragments of thought.
<0394> \{［伶］}
<0395> (I see. The original owner of this room is,
<0396> \ So it wasn't Takami, but his father...
<0397> When I noticed this and looked at the room again,
<0398> From all over this room,
<0399> I can definitely sense the strong presence of someone other than Takami.
<0400> And the reason why Takami visits this annex so many times is,
<0401> Rei had an idea.
<0402> \{［伶］}
<0403> (... Takami learned of the existence of the Angel called Nozomi,
<0404> \ It was from the records that person left behind.
<0405> \ He is the one who holds the truly important information about Nozomi.)
<0406> \{［伶］}
<0407> (Just as I came here seeking information from Takami,
<0408> \ The information that person has kept secret,
<0409> \ Assuming Takami is still seeking it...
<0410> \{［伶］}
<0411> (The reason Takami returns to this annex every day is
<0412> \ This room that belonged to that person,
<0413> \ Isn't this proof that Takami hasn't fully investigated yet?
<0414> \{［伶］}
<0415> (So, in this room,
<0416> \ Important information that even Takami doesn't know about is left somewhere.
<0417> \ That's a possibility -- so that's what I mean.)
<0418> If this wasn't Takami's room, but his father's,
<0419> Naturally, Rei's way of exploring will change.
<0420> The most notable thing to research in this room is
<0421> There was no search of Takami's belongings.
<0422> The idea was to find something that didn't seem like it belonged to him.
<0423> Yes, I noticed something strange about this picture,
<0424> It was a good decision to look into it.
<0425> What Rei learned by touching the fragments left in the frame:
<0426> This is the action that Takahisa repeatedly took with this painting.
<0427> In the past, Takahisa had picked up this frame many times,
<0428> And then-
<0429> Following Takahisa's memory that he peeked into,
<0430> Rei also tried removing the frame from the wall.
<0431> Then, on the wallpaper in the area that had been hidden by the painting,
<0432> Traces of unnatural dirt are found.
<0433> Yes, it was something that came naturally from touching it with my fingers so many times.
<0434> Traces of contact left on the wallpaper.
<0435> Just as Takahisa had done so many times, leaving traces behind,
<0436> Rei also touches the area to check.
<0437> \{［伶］}
<0438> (! This is――)
<0439> It appears to have been a small hidden door,
<0440> If you push hard, it will slide and create a hole in the wall.
<0441> I checked to see what was hidden behind the hidden door.
<0442> There was a small object there, just big enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
<0443> There was only one blue leather notebook that looked quite worn.
<0444> I took the notebook, flipped open the cover, and checked the contents.
<0445> The place is covered in dense handwritten text.
<0446> \{［伶］}
<0447> (The handwriting of this character is that of Kujo Takahisa.)
<0448> Apparently, Takami's father,
<0449> It appeared to be some kind of record written by hand.
<0450> \{［伶］}
<0451> (The notes left by that person...?)
<0452> Apparently, Takami is unaware of the existence of this diary.
<0453> Now that I've taken the journal away,
<0454> There is no need to worry about Takami realizing that you have entered the room.
<0455> \{［伶］}
<0456> (This is information Takami doesn't know yet. It might be useful.
<0457> \ I'll take it home and look into it--)
<0458> Rei puts Takahisa's notes into her breast pocket,
<0459> The frame was put back in place.
<0460> \{［伶］}
<0461> (--If we stay too long, Takami will return.
<0462> \ Oh well, I guess I'll wrap it up here...)
<0463> I gave up on investigating the room any further.
<0464> I decided to leave.
<0465> After erasing as many traces of her entry as possible, Rei left the room.
<0466> After leaving Takami's room without anyone noticing,
<0467> Rei went straight back to the mansion,
<0468> I headed to Nozomi's room to report the results of my investigation.
<0469> \{［伶］}
<0470> "Nozomi, sorry to have kept you waiting. I'm back now."
<0471> I opened the door without even hearing a knock,
<0472> Nozomi's face suddenly lit up,
<0473> As if he had been waiting impatiently, he rushes over to Rei's side.
<0474> \{［Hope］}
<0475> "I'm glad you're safe...!"
<0476> \{［伶］}
<0477> "I'm sorry for worrying you."
<0478> \{［Hope］}
<0479> "No! If Rei-san is safe,
<0480> \ That's fine."
<0481> \{［desire］}
<0482> "Um... so, how was it...?"
<0483> \{［伶］}
<0484> "Yes, I have learned a few things,
<0485> \ The truth of some things has never been revealed.
<0486> \{［伶］}
<0487> "The bottom line is that the results were not very good."
<0488> \{［desire］}
<0489> "Did you find out anything about me and Rei-san...?
<0490> And then... what about the Angels?
<0491> \{［伶］}
<0492> "...for me, and for you,
<0493> \ It's not a very pleasant story."
<0494> \{［Hope］}
<0495> "But still... I want to know.
<0496> \ Rei-san, please tell me...!
<0497> \{［伶］}
<0498> "--I understand. So, what information did I get in that room?
<0499> \ I'll tell you everything."
<0500> Rei uses the information she obtained in Takami's room.
<0501> I told Nozomi everything without hiding anything.
<0502> First, let's talk about Takahisa Kujo, who started it all.
<0503> Next, what he planned.
<0504> And about Rei and Nozomi,
<0505> About the Angels--
<0506> Nozomi looked serious,
<0507> I tried not to miss a single word Rei had said,
<0508> I listened in silence.
<0509> Even after Rei finished speaking, Nozomi continued to repeat the words she had just heard.
<0510> He seemed to be carefully sorting things out in his mind.
<0511> He remains silent and deep in thought, refusing to move.
<0512> \{［伶］}
<0513> "As your true guardian and mine,
<0514> \ I also found the diary of Kujo Takahisa, the man who started it all."
<0515> While worrying about Nozomi's condition,
<0516> I take out Takahisa's notebook that I got from Takami's room.
<0517> \{［伶］}
<0518> "Takami also seemed unaware of the existence of this diary.
<0519> \ Maybe we can get some valuable information."
<0520> Rei sat down next to Nozomi, who was watching with bated breath,
<0521> I begin to carefully read through the contents of my notebook.
<0522> Hypnosis Experiments
<0523> Description of <Angels>
<0524> About Hope
<0525> Enough already
<0526> Notes on hypnosis experiments by Kujo Takahisa.
<0527> Moreover, the subjects of this experiment are-
<0528> \{［伶］}
<0529> "This was done to me,
<0530> \ Record of hypnosis experiment...?
<0531> \{［伶］}
<0532> "Hypnosis experiment?
<0533> \ Why did that person do that to me..."
<0534> Takahisa even conducted a hypnosis experiment,
<0535> What information were you trying to get from Rei's spirit?
<0536> As I continued to read the records,
<0537> Rei found a surprising statement there.
<0538> “---Before the age of seven, Rei had been showing signs of Angelic power.
<0539> \ I was able to find it.
<0540> \ This is a conjecture based on the report provided by Mr. and Mrs. Saiga.
<0541> "But now, at age seven,
<0542> \ It is difficult to find any signs of angelic power in Rei.
<0543> "I tried every means to get him back into power,
<0544> \ The results are not good.
<0545> "To investigate Rei's mental state,
<0546> I have decided to subject Rei to a hypnosis experiment.
<0547> By reading the records left by Takahisa,
<0548> The memories that had been sleeping inside Rei slowly begin to come back to life.
<0549> \{［伶］}
<0550> "Yes - in the past, I certainly
<0551> \ I was once forced to participate in such an experiment..."
<0552> I had forgotten about it until today—or rather, I was made to forget about it,
<0553> As a subject of such a hypnosis experiment,
<0554> Once, Rei was forced to participate.
<0555> \{[Father]}
<0556> "Rei, I'm going to make you go to counseling.
<0557> \ Come with me."
<0558> My father told me so, and I was forcibly taken there.
<0559> In a room in a hospital somewhere,
<0560> I have had the experience of being given drugs and put to sleep on several occasions.
<0561> "According to the results of several hypnosis experiments,
<0562> \ Rei, by some strong suggestion,
<0563> \ It seems that his memories of the past have been sealed away.
<0564> "Unless the hints cast upon you are resolved, the power of Rei that you will never cease to seek will be lost.
<0565> \ I might never wake up—"
<0566> "How do you awaken the power of Rei?
<0567> \ This is likely to be the most concerning issue going forward.
<0568> \{［伶］}
<0569> "Is what is written in the notebook true?
<0570> \ Before I was seven, I was told that I had signs of the power of an angel.
<0571> \ What is this description...?
<0572> \{［伶］}
<0573> "...I don't know. I don't remember anything.
<0574> \ What is the power of the Angel that I once possessed?
<0575> "In 19XX, I met an angel."
<0576> The longest written piece about the mysterious <Angel>
<0577> The page, dated 24 years ago,
<0578> It all started with Takahisa's mysterious words.
<0579> It is a memoir of Takahisa's past experiences,
<0580> It seemed to be something he had left in his notebook.
<0581> \{［伶］}
<0582> (Is this a record of that person's encounter with the Angel?
<0583> \ Then, if you read this note,
<0584> \ And do you know how he got hold of the Angel's blood?
<0585> Rei traces Takahisa's memories,
<0586> I slowly follow the small letters filling the page.
<0587> "What happened that day changed everything in my life."
<0588> “At that time, I had just turned 24,
<0589> I was the only person on a plane bound for Europe for business.
<0590> “The plane that was carrying me to Europe
<0591> \ It was definitely over the ocean when it was struck by lightning.
<0592> "However, if you notice,
<0593> I was in a deep fog, not knowing where I was.
<0594> "I wasn't the only one in the fog.
<0595> \ Another person - who had just turned 18 at the time,
<0596> That man was by my side.
<0597> "He was apparently on the same plane as me,
<0598> \ Our seats were far apart,
<0599> \ Our first encounter was in the fog.
<0600> "Without understanding what had happened to us,
<0601> \ In the white darkness where you can't even see the tips of your fingers stretched out in front of you,
<0602> \ The two of us wander aimlessly
<0603> "How much time has passed since then?"
<0604> "Before I knew it, that man and I
<0605> \ Surrounded by a crystal-like wall never before seen,
<0606> \ I was lost in a mysterious place.
<0607> "We are called by an irresistible force,
<0608> \ I proceeded without hesitation into this otherworldly place,
<0609> \ Eventually, I met an Angel.
<0610> "We called that being an 'Angel' because
<0611> \ It is exactly as described in the Bible and legends,
<0612> \ Because he was prepared for it.
<0613> "Yes - that being had shining wings on its back.
<0614> \ Just as the legend says.
<0615> "But the Angel was in captivity."
<0616> “His eyes were wrapped in layers of white cloth,
<0617> \ Bound to the throne I sit on like a criminal—"
<0618> “The cruelest thing of all is what determines the fate of that being,
<0619> \ Piercing through the chest of the man clad in his long garment,
<0620> \ A stone spear sewn to the back of the throne—"
<0621> "And what's most surprising of all is,
<0622> \ The Angels were living in that form.
<0623> Reading that far, Rei gasped in surprise.
<0624> \{［伶］}
<0625> (Is this description the same as the angel I saw in my dream?)
<0626> \{［伶］}
<0627> (Could that angel I saw in my dream be...?
<0628> \ Is this the same Angel that person met...?
<0629> \{［伶］}
<0630> (No way...)
<0631> “Though bound like a criminal, I will not be impure,
<0632> \ To that being that boasts overwhelming brilliance,
<0633> \ I was captivated at first sight.
<0634> "However, with our power,
<0635> \ It is impossible to free the Angel from the wedge,
<0636> \ We'll find out after a few tries.
<0637> "But both me and that man,
<0638> \ We share the same desire to never give up.
<0639> "Someday, somehow,
<0640> \ When you release the Angel from the wedge,
<0641> \ We both made a heartfelt vow to the Angel.
<0642> “The Angels are to each of us,
<0643> \ I command you to touch your fettered hands.
<0644> “When we obey, the Angels will send messages directly to our brains,
<0645> \ I have given you some information about the Angels.
<0646> “Based on that information,
<0647> \ I had a secret conversation with an Angel in my mind.
<0648> "As a means of liberation,
<0649> I conveyed an idea to the Angel.
<0650> "For that attempt,
<0651> I begged to inherit the blood of the Angel.
<0652> “The Angel understands my wishes and aims,
<0653> \ He said he would allow me to do that.
<0654> "However, only the following will be allowed for the purpose of experimentation:
<0655> \ At the same time, we are told that there is only one
<0656> "What words did you exchange with the Angel that day?
<0657> I didn't tell that man about it.
<0658> "In return, I,
<0659> \ I didn't ask what the man had said to the Angel.
<0660> “The man and I do not ask this question, but we are in each other’s hearts,
<0661> \ The words exchanged with the Angel are hidden.
<0662> “I later learned from him,
<0663> He said that he had been hearing the voice of an angel in his dreams for a long time.
<0664> “On that special day, he was on that plane,
<0665> It wasn't by chance, but by the guidance of an Angel—"
<0666> “When I found out about that, I told that man,
<0667> \ It's only natural that he secretly harbored hostility.
<0668> "But—we started out,
<0669> \ We were irreplaceable friends, walking the same path.
<0670> “We are both captivated by the same dream, we hold the same wish,
<0671> \ We made the same vow,
<0672> \ They were brothers and sisters, bound by a strong bond unlike any other in the world.
<0673> “And then, before we knew it, we were standing side by side,
<0674> \ The two of them were supposed to reach their goal together,
<0675> \ Each of us chose a different path.
<0676> “To the extent that neither of us can ever accept the path the other has chosen,
<0677> The gap between them was deep,
<0678> \ The separation has become inevitable--"
<0679> “A replica in the likeness of the Angel,
<0680> \ If he knew that I had made it, he would surely be angry at my actions,
<0681> \ There will be reproach and grief.
<0682> “But the desire to create an Angel with my own hands,
<0683> \ Using that power, we attempt to free our Angel,
<0684> I just can't give up.
<0685> “This hand can never reach, a crazy dream from which I can never wake up,
<0686> \ Former friends bound together――"
<0687> “My deepest understanding and greatest rival.
<0688> \ The reason why we named our Angel "Laciel" is
<0689> \ It was originally his idea.
<0690> “It was inherited from a parent who was a \ruby{collector}={collector},
<0691> \ In the "Book of Angels" that he had owned for a long time,
<0692> \ It is the name of an angel whose face resembles our Angel.
<0693> “My friend and I have long called the Angel,
<0694> \ That heretical being--"
<0695> “What is that entity that we should call in the true sense?
<0696> \ This opportunity for me to learn about it,
<0697> \ It's probably gone forever - perhaps for the rest of your life."
<0698> "Once upon a time, my friends and I called an angel,
<0699> \ We met"
<0700> "Asaba Nozomi is a person created from the blood of an Angel.
<0701> \ To make our dreams come true,
<0702> \ He is also the key player in the plan I have drawn up.
<0703> “However, Nozomi is far from being a perfect angel.
<0704> \ They are immature and incomplete creatures.
<0705> Even after reading through the notes written by Takahisa himself,
<0706> After all, what kind of being is an angel?
<0707> The answer was never revealed before Rei.
<0708> What I learned is,
<0709> 24 years ago, the <Angel> actually existed before Takahisa's eyes.
<0710> That it was a real existence.
<0711> I don't remember, but when I was seven years old,
<0712> There were signs that the power of the Angels had awakened.
<0713> \{［伶］}
<0714> "...If this record is not incorrect,
<0715> \ It seems that there really is something inside me,
<0716> \ It seems that the power of the Angels still lies dormant within them.
<0717> \{［伶］}
<0718> "The power of an Angel...?"
<0719> \{［伶］}
<0720> "I have the power to read the fragments of people's hearts--"
<0721> \{［伶］}
<0722> "Your ability to hear the inner voices of living things--"
<0723> \{［伶］}
<0724> "These powers are given to us by the blood of the Angels,
<0725> \ Perhaps it's a manifestation of a special ability."
<0726> \{［desire］}
<0727> "My powers are... those of an Angel?"
<0728> \{［伶］}
<0729> "However - although it is certainly a heretical ability,
<0730> \ It's a small power that can't do anything great."
<0731> \{［伶］}
<0732> "This level of power is of little practical use,
<0733> \ Calling it "a power that can even plunge the world into chaos,"
<0734> \ I don't think they're desperately looking for it.
<0735> \{［伶］}
<0736> "I feel that the true power of an Angel is much more than this.
<0737> \ The more that person and the owner of the voice you heard desire,
<0738> \ I think it's an ability that can do even greater things--"
<0739> \{［伶］}
<0740> "I don't know what kind of ability it is,
<0741> \ I can't even imagine it..."
<0742> \{［desire］}
<0743> "...The power of an angel lies dormant within you, Rei-san..."
<0744> \{［伶］}
<0745> "Even so, it wasn't a complete waste of time,
<0746> \ We didn't get any information that will be useful to us in the future."
<0747> \{［伶］}
<0748> "What kind of being is an angel?
<0749> \ What kind of ability is the power of an angel?
<0750> \ Who is the person who is after the power of the Angels?
<0751> \{［伶］}
<0752> "Everything is left vague..."
<0753> \{［Hope］}
<0754> "......"
<0755> Nozomi looked depressed and at a loss for words.
<0756> I smiled kindly to try and ease their anxiety as much as possible,
<0757> Rei patted his thin back and said.
<0758> \{［伶］}
<0759> "--Well, there's no point in thinking about it.
<0760> \ Today, take it easy and rest your body and mind,
<0761> \ Let's prepare for tomorrow."
<0762> \{［伶］}
<0763> "Oh... perhaps you,
<0764> \ I bet you were so nervous you couldn't even eat your breakfast.
<0765> \{［Hope］}
<0766> "Um, that's right..."
<0767> \{［伶］}
<0768> "That's not good.
<0769> \ You won't make it through tomorrow at that rate, you know?
<0770> \{［Hope］}
<0771> "Y-yes, sorry...!"
<0772> \{［伶］}
<0773> "Well then, let's have dinner together.
<0774> \ It's a little late, but
<0775> \ Lunch should be ready in the dining hall."
<0776> \{［伶］}
<0777> "I'll ask Marie to make me some delicious tea.
<0778> \ I'm looking forward to the dessert after the meal."
<0779> \{［伶］}
<0780> "Come on, let's go together, Nozomi."
<0781> \{［Hope］}
<0782> "...Yes!"
<0783> I stood up and held out my hand,
<0784> Nozomi looked up at Rei's face and finally returned the smile.
<0785> Now that we're both alone,
<0786> I want time to think things through calmly,
<0787> Rei and Nozomi were in agreement.
<0788> So, after discussing tomorrow's procedures,
<0789> After parting ways with Nozomi, Rei returned to her room and quietly became lost in thought.
<0790> The mysterious Angel,
<0791> The secret of the power sleeping within Rei, and the identity of the one targeting the Angel――
<0792> I was worried about the things I had been left without understanding,
<0793> I somehow managed to change my mood and think about tomorrow.
<0794> \{［伶］}
<0795> (...There are too many uncertain factors,
<0796> \ It's hard to make a highly probable prediction,
<0797> \ I guess that can't be helped――)
<0798> \{［伶］}
<0799> (Anyway, after successfully obtaining the key from Takami,
<0800> \ To leave this mansion as soon as possible,
<0801> \ A getaway car must be prepared.)
<0802> \{［伶］}
<0803> (I can drive a car,
<0804> \ Find a car in this mansion that meets the conditions for escape,
<0805> \ It's difficult to get the key without arousing suspicion...)
<0806> \{［伶］}
<0807> (Furthermore, during the escape,
<0808> \ There's no point if the car you prepare isn't ready to go right away.
<0809> \ We need to hold off other cars so we don't get chased...)
<0810> \{［伶］}
<0811> (To a certain extent, I can manipulate it in advance,
<0812> \ After Takami arrived at the mansion,
<0813> \ There are too many things to do before we can escape.)
<0814> \{［伶］}
<0815> (Since I have to deal with Takami,
<0816> \ Everything will be done after the key is stolen.)
<0817> \{［伶］}
<0818> (...Then there are too many uncertainties.)
<0819> \{［伶］}
<0820> (I need at least one more collaborator.
<0821> \ While I was holding Takami back,
<0822> \ A collaborator who will disable all the cars in the mansion is――)
<0823> \{［伶］}
<0824> (It leads to the inside of the mansion,
<0825> \ Someone who can tell us the number and location of cars in the mansion――)
<0826> When Rei thought about it, something came to his mind.
<0827> The cheerful smile of a young girl who takes care of Rei and Nozomi at the mansion.
<0828> \{［伶］}
<0829> (Mari...?)
<0830> He seems to genuinely care about Rei and Nozomi.
<0831> Sometimes I think I've surpassed my role as a maid.
<0832> Marie serves with dedication and dedication.
<0833> Nozomi was brought in as a commodity.
<0834> He is genuinely concerned and shows compassionate words and actions at every opportunity.
<0835> A kind-hearted maid girl.
<0836> If Rei were to find someone she could rely on in this mansion,
<0837> There's no one else like Marie.
<0838> But... can I really trust Marie?
<0839> I was confused for a while about what to choose.
<0840> \{［伶］}
<0841> (Mariie also works at this mansion.
<0842> \ I don't know how much I can trust and rely on this person.
<0843> \ It's better to have as many allies as possible...)
<0844> I want to believe in Marie's kind eyes.
<0845> However, this decision, which will determine Nozomi's fate,
<0846> Failure is not an option.
<0847> \{［伶］}
<0848> (Mari's eyes -- should I believe them?)
<0849> Believe in Marie
<0850> No one believes me
<0851> \{［伶］}
<0852> (--There is no lie in the eyes Marie looks at Nozomi.
<0853> \ I... believe in Marie)
<0854> Having made up her mind, Rei gets Marie's cooperation,
<0855> I made up my mind to tell him everything.
<0856> \{［伶］}
<0857> (So, while we're at it,
<0858> \ I'll do everything I can...)
<0859> To complete the remaining tasks necessary for the escape,
<0860> Rei secretly took action.
<0861> That night, trying to cheer up the somewhat restless Nozomi,
<0862> With Marie's enthusiastic encouragement,
<0863> Rei ends up having dinner with Nozomi.
<0864> As Rei sat down in the seat prepared for her,
<0865> From the other side of the beautifully decorated table with plates of food lined up
<0866> Nozomi speaks softly.
<0867> \{［Hope］}
<0868> "Um...Rei-san."
<0869> \{［Hope］}
<0870> "There is something I would like to discuss with you, Rei-san.
<0871> \ Could you come to my room tonight...?
<0872> \{［伶］}
<0873> "I understand. ...I think it will be a little late, but
<0874> \ I'll head to your room later."
<0875> \{［Hope］}
<0876> "Yes! I'll be waiting...!"
<0877> \{[Mari]}
<0878> "Well, I've really shown my skills tonight,
<0879> \ Please enjoy your meal together."
<0880> Marie brought the steaming soup,
<0881> He called out to the two with a cheerful smile.
<0882> Perhaps it was the tension of thinking about tomorrow,
<0883> Nozomi didn't seem to be able to eat much of the dinner.
<0884> He seemed to be trying to act natural,
<0885> Nozomi is somewhere in the background, lost in thought.
<0886> Knocking over a glass of water with your elbow,
<0887> He keeps slipping his fork and spilling food, making him restless.
<0888> After finishing the meal, which was somewhat tense,
<0889> Rei enjoyed the aroma of the coffee that Marie had poured for her.
<0890> Just before leaving the cafeteria, I called out to Marie.
<0891> \{［伶］}
<0892> "--Mari. It's fine after you've finished your work at the mansion.
<0893> \ Could you come to my room?
<0894> \ I have a confidential matter I'd like you to discuss.
<0895> \{[Mari]}
<0896> "Do you have something to ask me... Rei-sama?"
<0897> \{[Mari]}
<0898> "I'm so happy...! I'll definitely come to your room!"
<0899> \{［伶］}
<0900> "...I'll be counting on you."
<0901> And so, before going to bed,
<0902> After dinner, he whispered to me and called me to his room.
<0903> I quietly waited for Marie to arrive.
<0904> \{[Mari]}
<0905> "Rei-sama, I'm very late.
<0906> \ This is Marie.
<0907> A voice echoed from the other side of the door.
<0908> Marie quietly called out to him,
<0909> Rei closes the book she has been absentmindedly reading.
<0910> \{［伶］}
<0911> "Oh, it's nice to see you. Come in."
<0912> \{[Mari]}
<0913> "Excuse me for calling so late.
<0914> \ Rei-sama, I hear you have something confidential to tell me,
<0915> \ What can I do for you...?
<0916> \{［伶］}
<0917> "I want you to keep this a secret from the people in the mansion.
<0918> \ I have something very important to tell you."
<0919> \{［伶］}
<0920> "I trust you and confide in you.
<0921> \ So please keep this a secret from everyone."
<0922> \{[Mari]}
<0923> "Yes, yes! What kind of story is it?"
<0924> Get in touch with Marie's heart
<0925> There's no need to check
<0926> \{［伶］}
<0927> "Mari...can you give me your hand?"
<0928> \{[Mari]}
<0929> "Yes... like this?"
<0930> With a gentle smile, she held out her hand.
<0931> Rei held it gently.
<0932> \{[Mari]}
<0933> "Ah..."
<0934> \{［伶］}
<0935> "Tomorrow, Takami will come to the mansion with Nozomi.
<0936> \ The day to hand over hope has come..."
<0937> \{[Mari]}
<0938> "Eh...?! No way... Nozomi...!"
<0939> Through his clenched hands, he touched Marie's heart,
<0940> Kind and compassionate thoughts,
<0941> It turns into a soft, warm light that dances gently and reaches Rei's heart.
<0942> As expected, Marie's many considerations towards Nozomi,
<0943> A considerate attitude,
<0944> It wasn't an act or a pretense, it was genuine.
<0945> \{［伶］}
<0946> (...I'm glad I trusted Marie.)
<0947> It warms my heart when I touch it.
<0948> Rei smiled at the warmth coming from Marie's light.
<0949> \{［伶］}
<0950> "For Nozomi's sake, I need your help..."
<0951> \{[Mari]}
<0952> "Yes, of course...!
<0953> \ If you command me, I will always..."
<0954> \{［伶］}
<0955> "No, that's not it. That's not what I meant.
<0956> \ This is my personal wish,
<0957> \ This is a request that goes beyond the relationship between the owner and maid of the mansion."
<0958> \{[Mari]}
<0959> "Rei-sama...? Um, what on earth is that..."
<0960> \{［伶］}
<0961> "I need your help in betraying this mansion."
<0962> \{[Mari]}
<0963> "Ah...! Rei-sama, that means...!"
<0964> \{［伶］}
<0965> "I... want to save Nozomi."
<0966> \{[Mari]}
<0967> "Ah, so that's what I thought...!"
<0968> \{［伶］}
<0969> "Of course, you're welcome to decline our cooperation.
<0970> \ Because it puts you in danger.
<0971> \ However, even after I decline, I would like you not to tell anyone about this."
<0972> \{［伶］}
<0973> "I believe in you"
<0974> \{［伶］}
<0975> "So please, I need your help.
<0976> \ To save Nozomi from this mansion..."
<0977> \{［伶］}
<0978> "I know this may put you in danger, but
<0979> \ But even so, I hope to borrow your strength."
<0980> \{[Mari]}
<0981> "Rei-sama...!!"
<0982> \{[Mari]}
<0983> "Thank you for disclosing such a big secret to me.
<0984> \ Thank you so much!
<0985> \ I'm so happy that you trust me, Rei-sama...!"
<0986> \{[Mari]}
<0987> "I'll help you two!
<0988> \ Please let us cooperate!
<0989> \{[Mari]}
<0990> "Please, give me any orders you like.
<0991> \ I will definitely be of help to you, Rei-sama!
<0992> \{［伶］}
<0993> "Thank you, Marie..."
<0994> \{［伶］}
<0995> "Well, I don't need to get straight to the point,
<0996> \ There's something I'd like you to do by tomorrow morning.
<0997> \ And then, after Takami showed up at the mansion--"
<0998> \{[Mari]}
<0999> "Yes...! Please feel free to give me your orders."
<1000> Takami comes to pick up Nozomi, and while Rei holds him back,
<1001> Regarding the work that must be left to Marie:
<1002> Then, regarding the procedure from stealing the key to escaping,
<1003> Rei has a thorough discussion with Marie.
<1004> We made sure to thoroughly understand each other's work,
<1005> The meeting to discuss the work that needs to be done in advance has also ended.
<1006> All that remains is the actual work of putting the plan into action.
<1007> In the end, Marie, who is well-informed about the situation inside the building,
<1008> I ended up leaving most of the pre-planning to you,
<1009> Marie willingly accepted the task.
<1010> It's true that Rei would stand out if she moved around the building doing some crafts.
<1011> It would probably be best to leave this to Marie.
<1012> \{［伶］}
<1013> "I'm counting on you, Marie. I'm entrusting everything to you.
<1014> \ I'm sorry to have dragged you into this, but I'm counting on you."
<1015> \{[Mari]}
<1016> "Thank you, Rei-sama!!
<1017> \ Please rest assured and leave it to me.
<1018> \ I'll do it well!
<1019> \{[Mari]}
<1020> "Umm... Rei-sama. Thank you for relying on me.
<1021> \ Thank you very much.
<1022> \ I will do my best to live up to Rei-sama's trust!
<1023> \{[Mari]}
<1024> "When Rei-sama is in trouble, please think of me,
<1025> \ Please be sure to call me.
<1026> \ I'm always on Rei-sama's side..."
<1027> \{［伶］}
<1028> "Mari..."
<1029> \{[Mari]}
<1030> "Well then, I'll be off. Now,
<1031> \ I'll start taking action, like arranging for a car."
<1032> \{［伶］}
<1033> "I know I'm causing you trouble, but I'll be counting on you."
<1034> \{[Mari]}
<1035> "Yes, please leave it to me!"
<1036> Marie smiled happily at Rei's words,
<1037> I quietly left Rei's room, trying not to be seen.
<1038> With this, Rei had done everything she could.
<1039> All that remains is to lie down and wait for the promised day to arrive.
<1040> The die has already been cast. Will the choice be good or bad?
<1041> All the answers will be revealed tomorrow morning.
<1042> It was already quite late,
<1043> I once promised to visit his room.
<1044> I decided to tell Nozomi about tomorrow tonight.
<1045> Rei hurried to Nozomi's room.
<1046> Rei is in a position where she can treat Nozomi however she likes,
<1047> I visited Nozomi's room late at night,
<1048> You will never be looked upon with suspicion.
<1049> I wondered what purpose he had in visiting Nozomi at this time.
<1050> This may have led to unwarranted suspicion,
<1051> Thanks to that, I wasn't stopped by any security guards.
<1052> I knocked on the door and called out to Nozomi.
<1053> A voice from inside quickly answered.
<1054> It seems that Nozomi had been waiting for Rei to come for a long time.
<1055> \{［伶］}
<1056> "What's wrong? Are you nervous and not going to sleep tonight?
<1057> \ I think it would be best if you rested..."
<1058> \{［desire］}
<1059> "Yes. But... when I think about tomorrow,
<1060> \ My heart is pounding..."
<1061> \{［伶］}
<1062> "With Marie's help, we will leave this mansion tomorrow.
<1063> \ I know you're worried, but will you come with me?
<1064> \{［desire］}
<1065> "Yes, of course...!
<1066> \ If I'm with you, Rei-san, I'll go anywhere!
<1067> \{［伶］}
<1068> "By the way, what exactly is it that you want to discuss?
<1069> \ Does it concern tomorrow?
<1070> \{［desire］}
<1071> "Um...um..."
<1072> \{［伶］}
<1073> "...Nozomi? What's the matter? Is there something you don't want me to know?"
<1074> \{［desire］}
<1075> "Um...! Rei-san...!"
<1076> \{［伶］}
<1077> "...?"
<1078> \{［desire］}
<1079> "...me..."
<1080> \{［desire］}
<1081> "Make me yours..."
<1082> Her face was stained with shame and she bowed her head slightly.
<1083> Nozomi spoke in a trembling voice that was almost inaudible.
<1084> \{［伶］}
<1085> “Nozomi…!?”
<1086> Rei's eyes widened at the sudden words,
<1087> Nozomi raised her gaze with determination,
<1088> Looking straight into Rei's eyes, he spoke clearly once more.
<1089> \{［desire］}
<1090> "Make me yours."
<1091> \{［伶］}
<1092> "...Why did you suddenly do that?"
<1093> \{［desire］}
<1094> "I want to help you..."
<1095> \{［desire］}
<1096> "Umm...Rei-san,
<1097> \ You made it very clear to me."
<1098> \{［desire］}
<1099> "I... sleep inside Rei-san,
<1100> \ Prepared to awaken the power of the Angel,
<1101> \ That's the kind of existence it is..."
<1102> Hearing those words, Rei found something in Takami's room.
<1103> I recall a sentence from the record.
<1104> “Chosen for the Angel,
<1105> \ A special child with the blood of an Angel――"
<1106> “I have a deep feeling for this boy,
<1107> \ Give the name of hope”
<1108> \{［伶］}
<1109> "...trapped in delusion,
<1110> \ The words left behind by people who have already passed away,
<1111> \ You don't need to worry about it."
<1112> \{［desire］}
<1113> "I'm fine."
<1114> \{［hope］}
<1115> "Whatever the reason, I'm glad I met you.
<1116> \ I truly believe that...!"
<1117> \{［伶］}
<1118> “Nozomi…”
<1119> \{［hope］}
<1120> "So... ever since then,
<1121> \ I was thinking..."
<1122> \{［desire］}
<1123> "How can I, even someone like me,
<1124> \ I wonder if I can help you, Rei-san..."
<1125> \{［desire］}
<1126> "I've been thinking about it..."
<1127> \{［desire］}
<1128> "......"
<1129> \{［desire］}
<1130> "...the resonance phenomenon is the key to awakening the power of angels,
<1131> \ You said so."
<1132> “If on the one hand there is one who awakens to the power of the Angels,
<1133> \ The angels who have not yet awakened also resonate with that power,
<1134> \ There is a high possibility that it will awaken dormant powers.
<1135> “So, there is a possibility that this could be the catalyst for Rei’s awakening.
<1136> \ I propose to create another tool using Angel blood as a base.
<1137> \{［hope］}
<1138> "What is the true power of an Angel?
<1139> \ I don't know..."
<1140> \{［desire］}
<1141> "Perhaps, if you connect deeply with me,
<1142> \ More power to Rei-san,
<1143> \ I thought maybe I could give it to you..."
<1144> \{［伶］}
<1145> "...Is that what you were thinking?"
<1146> \{［desire］}
<1147> "Yes..."
<1148> \{［desire］}
<1149> "I... like Rei-san.
<1150> \ I want to protect Rei-san more than anyone else..."
<1151> \{［hope］}
<1152> "If I can be of any help to you,
<1153> \ I'll do anything...!
<1154> \{［desire］}
<1155> "So... so..."
<1156> \{［desire］}
<1157> "Hold me... please..."
<1158> \{［伶］}
<1159> "You're--that far,
<1160> \ Do you wish to help me...?
<1161> \{［desire］}
<1162> "Yes...!"
<1163> He truly loves Rei and wishes to be of help to her.
<1164> The feelings that flow from a heart of longing,
<1165> The warmth is transmitted to the touching fingertips.
<1166> Bravely... and single-mindedly,
<1167> His earnest gaze, which shows his sincere love for Rei,
<1168> Rei felt a deep emotion in her heart.
<1169> In the dry vessel deep inside Rei's chest,
<1170> The warm, clear water that Nozomi gently poured into me,
<1171> As if filling the emptiness in my heart little by little...
<1172> The love for Nozomi that filled Rei's heart,
<1173> Finally, it overflows from my heart.
<1174> With overwhelming emotions, I embraced Nozomi's body.
<1175> Rei's thoughts are gently conveyed to his ears.
<1176> \{［伶］}
<1177> "I love you too."
<1178> \{［hope］}
<1179> "......!"
<1180> With a strength that rivals the feelings Nozomi has for Rei,
<1181> The words Rei conveyed with all her heart were,
<1182> It seemed to resonate deeply with Nozomi's heart.
<1183> The fingers around Rei's back as she embraces Nozomi,
<1184> A strong force is applied.
<1185> Even without any further words to convey my feelings,
<1186> Stronger than ever, indeed,
<1187> The fact that their hearts are connected is conveyed to each other's hearts.
<1188> As when wielding the power to touch the heart,
<1189> The feeling of power that makes the world change its colors brilliantly,
<1190> It flows from our connected hearts and fills our hearts.
<1191> I feel your heart so close that I could touch it.
<1192> Nozomi probably also feels close to Rei's heart.
<1193> \{［伶］}
<1194> "Thank you - Nozomi.
<1195> \ I'm very happy about your feelings."
<1196> \{［伶］}
<1197> "See -- you understand, don't you, Nozomi...?"
<1198> \{［伶］}
<1199> "If our hearts can communicate this well,
<1200> \ Even without connecting bodies,
<1201> \ We are deeply connected--"
<1202> \{［伶］}
<1203> "Just by embracing each other so tightly and touching each other's skin,
<1204> \ Your power is definitely being transmitted to me..."
<1205> \{［desire］}
<1206> "Yes...!
<1207> \ I understand that too..."
<1208> \{［desire］}
<1209> "My...power,
<1210> \ I think it's getting through to you..."
<1211> \{［desire］}
<1212> "A beautiful sound... Your heart and
<1213> \ And I can hear it from my chest..."
<1214> \{［desire］}
<1215> "Two sounds overlapping - resonating,
<1216> \ It's like a new kind of music is being born..."
<1217> \{［desire］}
<1218> "It's a very... beautiful sound."
<1219> \{［desire］}
<1220> "This is what the feeling of loving someone resonates with.
<1221> \ Is it the tone...?
<1222> \{［伶］}
<1223> "Yes, that may be true..."
<1224> Nozomi muttered these words with a blissful, enchanted look on her face.
<1225> Rei also quietly listens to the music that she shouldn't be able to hear.
<1226> \{［desire］}
<1227> "Umm...Rei-san."
<1228> \{［desire］}
<1229> "I really love you...!"
<1230> \{［desire］}
<1231> "Meeting you here,
<1232> \ It was the luckiest thing I've ever had.
<1233> \ I'm so happy right now...!
<1234> Single-mindedly and bravely,
<1235> He reveals all his longing to Rei without hiding anything,
<1236> Nozomi's smile looks defenseless and happy.
<1237> While we were touching each other like this,
<1238> I feel like I never want to let go.
<1239> It's fine as it is now
<1240> I want to have hope
<1241> \{［伶］}
<1242> "For now... it's fine the way it is."
<1243> \{［desire］}
<1244> "Rei-san..."
<1245> \{［伶］}
<1246> "...The night is getting late.
<1247> \ You'd better get some rest now in preparation for tomorrow."
<1248> \{［伶］}
<1249> "How is it? Do you think you'll be able to sleep tonight?"
<1250> \{［desire］}
<1251> "...I'm a little...unsure."
<1252> \{［伶］}
<1253> "Then tonight, until you fall asleep,
<1254> \ Shall we talk alone?
<1255> \{［伶］}
<1256> "I can't compete with your friend, the 'Angel Researcher,' but
<1257> \ I'll tell you the story of the angel I know."
<1258> \{［desire］}
<1259> "Really?! I'm so happy...!"
<1260> \{［伶］}
<1261> "I'd also like to hear your stories about your time living in the forest.
<1262> \ Can you talk to me later?
<1263> \{［desire］}
<1264> "Yes, with pleasure...!"
<1265> \{［desire］}
<1266> "Ah... but as for me,
<1267> \ There's nothing particularly unusual to say, but..."
<1268> \{［伶］}
<1269> "I don't mind. Even if it's something trivial,
<1270> \ I want to hear about you."
<1271> \{［伶］}
<1272> "Yeah... but when I start talking,
<1273> \ You might fall asleep soon.
<1274> \ Like the other afternoon..."
<1275> \{［desire］}
<1276> "Ah...! Um, I'm so, so sorry..."
<1277> \{［伶］}
<1278> "I don't mind. Falling asleep next to me,
<1279> \ That's proof that you trust me..."
<1280> \{［伶］}
<1281> "Now, let's talk..."
<1282> And so, by telling each other their memories,
<1283> The two spent the night in silence.
<1284> \{［伶］}
<1285> (...I can't trust Marie.)
<1286> \{［伶］}
<1287> (Mari's attitude towards Nozomi and me,
<1288> \ I'm not sure it's an act...)
<1289> \{［伶］}
<1290> (I have no intention of relying on Marie's power.
<1291> \ So I have no choice but to do everything myself.
<1292> If you don't ask for help,
<1293> The risks on the day will be greater, but that can't be helped.
<1294> Because that was the path Rei chose.
<1295> Having made up my mind, I then
<1296> Marie's presence, always close to Rei and Nozomi,
<1297> It becomes a nuisance.
<1298> On the day of the escape, Marie leaves their side,
<1299> We have no choice but to come up with a plan to expel him from the mansion.
<1300> After thinking for a while, Rei
<1301> I rang the bell to call Marie into my room.
<1302> \{[Mari]}
<1303> "Rei-sama, did someone call for you?"
<1304> \{［伶］}
<1305> "Yes. I had asked you to come over because I had something to ask you.
<1306> \ ...Is that okay?
<1307> \{[Mari]}
<1308> "Yes, please! Please give me any orders."
<1309> \{［伶］}
<1310> "There's something I really want to ask you for.
<1311> \ Tomorrow evening, leave the mansion and go to my house,
<1312> \ Could you please go and take care of things?
<1313> \{［伶］}
<1314> "It's going to be late,
<1315> \ I think I'll probably be back the next day..."
<1316> \{[Mari]}
<1317> "I understand!
<1318> \ Well then, I'll leave tomorrow evening."
<1319> \{［伶］}
<1320> "Sorry, but I had to ask you."
<1321> \{[Mari]}
<1322> "Yes, leave it to me!"
<1323> Perhaps he was very happy that Rei had asked him for a favor,
<1324> Marie took the note from Rei's hand,
<1325> He walked out of the room with a cheerful look on his face and a light step.
<1326> Marie didn't seem to doubt Rei's words at all.
<1327> I feel just a little guilty.
<1328> I changed my mood to shake off my doubts,
<1329> With a secret resolve in her heart, Rei was alone.
<1330> We took action to complete the remaining tasks necessary for our escape.
<1331> \{［伶］}
<1332> "Even so, there is no decisive factor,
<1333> \ It's unfortunate that we didn't get any important information..."
<1334> \{［伶］}
<1335> "In the end, I don't know about angels either.
<1336> \ As for those who aim at the Angel,
<1337> \ The result was that no clues were obtained.
<1338> \{［desire］}
<1339> "...Rei-san..."
<1340> \{［伶］}
<1341> "Oh, there's nothing to worry about.
<1342> \ No information was obtained,
<1343> \ But that doesn't mean the situation has changed dramatically.
<1344> Unable to shake off the anxious thoughts that occupy my mind,
<1345> I spoke some comforting words,
<1346> Nozomi also becomes uneasy, as if sensing Rei's anxiety.
<1347> In the end, that day,
<1348> I tried to comfort the frightened and depressed heart of Nozomi,
<1349> Rei stayed by Nozomi's side until night fell.
<1350> The mysterious Angel,
<1351> The secret of the power sleeping within Rei, and the identity of the one targeting the Angel――
<1352> I was worried about the things I had been left without understanding,
<1353> I somehow managed to change my mood and think about tomorrow.
<1354> \{［伶］}
<1355> (...There are too many uncertain factors,
<1356> \ It's hard to make a highly probable prediction,
<1357> \ I guess that can't be helped――)
<1358> \{［伶］}
<1359> (Anyway, after successfully getting the key from Takami,
<1360> \ To leave this mansion as soon as possible,
<1361> \ A getaway car must be prepared.)
<1362> \{［伶］}
<1363> (I can drive a car,

<1367> (Furthermore, during the escape,
<1368> \ There's no point if the car you prepare isn't ready to go right away.
<1369> \ We need to hold off other cars so we don't get chased...)
<1370> \{［伶］}
<1371> (To a certain extent, I can manipulate it in advance,
<1372> \ After Takami came to the mansion,
