#character '[Rei]'
#character '[Marie]'

<0000> The evening twilight passes in the blink of an eye,
<0001> After Rei accepted Takami's invitation and stayed at this mansion,
<0002> The fourth night has come.
<0003> After dinner, until it was time to look at the stars
<0004> Wait, Rei and Marie stepped into the night garden.
<0005> There was not the slightest hint of rain, and the air was clear.
<0006> It was a pleasant night, perfect for stargazing.
<0007> With her back to the mansion building,
<0008> I was looking for a place far away from the lights where I could see the stars clearly.
<0009> While walking slowly in step with Marie,
<0010> Stroll through the garden on a dim night.
<0011> For a while, the two stood side by side in silence.
<0012> As thin and sharp as a cat's eyes at midday,
<0013> I stroll through the garden illuminated by moonlight falling from the crescent moon.
<0014> \{[Rei]}
<0015> "Ah... I think you can see the stars well around here.
<0016> \ Marie, is it okay to observe from here?
<0017> \{[Mari]}
<0018> "...Ah..."
<0019> \{[Rei]}
<0020> "What's wrong, come on over."
<0021> He looked a little nervous and bowed his head.
<0022> Marie was walking forward,
<0023> When I caught up with Rei, I looked up at the sky with determination.
<0024> \{[Mari]}
<0025> "Wa... ah...!"
<0026> \{[Mari]}
<0027> "Wow, it looks like it's going to rain...!"
<0028> \{[Rei]}
<0029> "......"
<0030> \{[Rei]}
<0031> "Ah... that's right.
<0032> \ Because it's a remote area, there's little light,
<0033> \ The stars are clearly visible.
<0034> \{[Mari]}
<0035> "......"
<0036> \{[Mari]}
<0037> "Those are all stars..."
<0038> \{[Mari]}
<0039> "Strong light, weak light...white light, blue light,
<0040> \ So many... it's amazing...!!"
<0041> \{[Rei]}
<0042> "You certainly can't see it like this in the city."
<0043> \{[Mari]}
<0044> "Yes... the depth of the darkness,
<0045> \ It really makes the stars stand out."
<0046> \{[Mari]}
<0047> "......"
<0048> \{[Mari]}
<0049> "Oh, I just saw a shooting star!
<0050> \ ...Ahh, again...!
<0051> Shouting out in joy every time a star falls,
<0052> Marie is gazing intently at the starry sky.
<0053> Seeing Marie like that, even Rei, who was standing next to her,
<0054> I begin to feel a strange, excited feeling, like I did as a child.
<0055> With each cheer Marie gave,
<0056> In Rei's heart,
<0057> The stars in the celestial sphere seemed to approach me more realistically.
<0058> \{[Rei]}
<0059> "But... it's strange."
<0060> \{[Rei]}
<0061> "You love the stars so much,
<0062> \ Haven't you ever thought of watching it outside?
<0063> \{[Mari]}
<0064> "Well... actually, there was one time when I was a child,
<0065> \ Sneaking out of the room at night,
<0066> \ I tried to watch the stars by myself.
<0067> \{[Mari]}
<0068> "But... at that time, I got lost,
<0069> \ The starlight reflected in my eyes,
<0070> \ Too sharp, too vivid, too scary..."
<0071> \{[Mari]}
<0072> "When I was young, I couldn't say anything.
<0073> \ I felt a chill in my heart..."
<0074> \{[Mari]}
<0075> "Since then, the stars have been my
<0076> \ I love it, but I'm also scared... A distant presence,
<0077> \ It was like that.
<0078> \{[Rei]}
<0079> "......"
<0080> \{[Mari]}
<0081> "...But the stars we are looking at now,
<0082> \ It doesn't look the same as it did back then."
<0083> \{[Mari]}
<0084> "Things that were scary when I was alone,
<0085> \ Why does it look different when we're together...?
<0086> \{[Mari]}
<0087> "......"
<0088> \{[Mari]}
<0089> "Above all, it's because I'm with Rei-sama..."
<0090> \{[Mari]}
<0091> "This starry sky is warm,
<0092> \ It's so soft... it's like the stars are smiling."
<0093> \{[Mari]}
<0094> "It looks like such a happy color, it makes my heart tremble."
<0095> \{[Mari]}
<0096> "……………………"
<0097> \{[Rei]}
<0098> "Mariie?"
<0099> \{[Mari]}
<0100> "...I'm sorry, I'm just happy."
<0101> When I looked, Marie said,
<0102> She wipes away tears with the lace on her sleeve.
<0103> \{[Mari]}
<0104> "I... I,
<0105> \ I'll never forget this night.
<0106> \{[Rei]}
<0107> "...That's an exaggeration.
<0108> \ It was just something I did on a whim."
<0109> \{[Mari]}
<0110> "No, even if it was just a whimsical action to Rei-sama,
<0111> \ For me,
<0112> \ I'm so happy I could cry...!
<0113> \{[Mari]}
<0114> "I'm more than happy about your kind feelings, Rei-sama.
<0115> \ ...Thank you very much."
<0116> To Rei beside him,
<0117> Marie smiled gently with teary eyes.
<0118> As Rei watched Marie, a thought suddenly occurred to her.
<0119> Something like nostalgia - something inexplicable,
<0120> I feel like I'm slowly rising.
<0121> \{[Rei]}
<0122> (...What is this?)
<0123> \{[Rei]}
<0124> (…………)
<0125> \{[Rei]}
<0126> (Not unpleasant...)
<0127> Unable to cope with these mysterious emotions,
<0128> Rei turned her gaze to the sky once again.
<0129> Then the two of them spent a long time together.
<0130> I gazed at the stars in silence and breathed in the soft night breeze.
