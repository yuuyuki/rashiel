<0000> May 3rd
<0001> \{[Mari]}
<0002> "Good morning, Rei-sama.
<0003> \ How are you feeling this morning, Rei-sama?
<0004> A cheerful voice waking you up in the morning,
<0005> Rei pushes open her heavy eyelids, which still refuse to wake up.
<0006> \{［伶］}
<0007> "...Good morning, Marie.
<0008> \ I'm not feeling too bad this morning.
<0009> \{[Mari]}
<0010> "I see, that's good!
<0011> \ If you are dissatisfied with the comfort of your bed,
<0012> \ Please feel free to contact me anytime.
<0013> \{[Mari]}
<0014> "Well then, breakfast is ready,
<0015> \ Please come to the dining room."
<0016> \{［伶］}
<0017> "Okay. I'll be there as soon as I'm ready."
<0018> After leaving the room and walking for a while,
<0019> Last night, Rei picked out a book for Nozomi,
<0020> I realized I forgot.
<0021> \{［伶］}
<0022> (It'd be a pain to go back and get it now.
<0023> \ There's no need to rush, so I guess I can do it next time...)
<0024> For a moment, I thought about going back to my room,
<0025> I quickly changed my mind and decided to head straight to the cafeteria.
<0026> I finished a light meal early,
<0027> As Rei poked at the fruit plate that was served for dessert,
<0028> Marie asked about my morning schedule.
<0029> \{[Mari]}
<0030> "Rei-sama, what are your plans for today?"
<0031> Go to Nozomi's room
<0032> Look around the mansion
<0033> Exit the mansion
<0034> Return to room
<0035> \{［伶］}
<0036> "That's right... First of all,
<0037> \ I'll go and check on Nozomi."
<0038> \{[Mari]}
<0039> "I have something I'd like to give to Nozomi-san,
<0040> \ I also went to Nozomi's room.
<0041> \ Would it be alright if I joined you...?
<0042> \{［伶］}
<0043> "I don't mind."
<0044> \{[Mari]}
<0045> "Thank you very much!
<0046> \ Now, I'm sorry, but please wait just a moment.
<0047> \ I'll lower the wagon..."
<0048> As I was heading to Nozomi's room with Marie,
<0049> From the corner of the corridor ahead,
<0050> It looked like two people were arguing and fighting.
<0051> A noisy exchange of voices can be heard.
<0052> \{[Mari]}
<0053> "Oh? What's the fuss about?"
<0054> I walked a little faster and turned the corner to see what was going on.
<0055> What Rei saw at the center of the commotion was,
<0056> A small boy wearing a white shirt,
<0057> A large man in black struggles to subdue the boy.
<0058> \{[Mari]}
<0059> "Ah...! That's Nozomi!
<0060> \ What on earth happened, Nozomi-san?!
<0061> A man in black, who appeared to be a security officer at the mansion, grabbed my arm.
<0062> The one who has been yelling so hard for a while now is,
<0063> Nozomi thought he was in his room.
<0064> What on earth is this?
<0065> Rei and Marie rush to the source of the commotion.
<0066> \{［伶］}
<0067> "Hey guys, what's all this fuss about?"
<0068> \{［Male］}
<0069> "Oh, Saiga-sama! What an unsightly sight..."
<0070> \{［伶］}
<0071> "No need to say hello. In a place like this,
<0072> \ What are you doing to Nozomi?
<0073> \{［Male］}
<0074> "I'm so sorry.
<0075> \ This product attempted to escape from the building,
<0076> \ I was just about to arrest him..."
<0077> \{［Hope］}
<0078> "Let go...!!
<0079> \ Please, I won't run away...!"
<0080> \{［Male］}
<0081> "Hey... don't act violently!
<0082> \ Do you think a mere commodity like you would want to be tied up?
<0083> \{［伶］}
<0084> "Wait, stop being so rough.
<0085> I don't remember giving you permission to do whatever you want."
<0086> \{［Male］}
<0087> "But, this guy tried to escape from the mansion..."
<0088> \{［Hope］}
<0089> "No, that's not it...!"
<0090> \{[Male]}
<0091> "How can you trust a word like that?
<0092> \ You tried to cross the garden boundary!
<0093> \{［Hope］}
<0094> "No...!
<0095> \ I won't run away... Let me go."
<0096> \{［Hope］}
<0097> "I can... hear... a voice..."
<0098> \{［Hope］}
<0099> "If this continues, that child will...!"
<0100> He looked very worried, unlike usual.
<0101> As Nozomi desperately tries to escape,
<0102> Rei whispers softly, as if blowing a cool breeze.
<0103> \{［伶］}
<0104> "Nozomi, calm down."
<0105> \{［desire］}
<0106> "Ah..."
<0107> \{［伶］}
<0108> "Listen carefully to what I have to say, Nozomi.
<0109> \ If this continues, you will
<0110> \ You'll lose a lot more freedom than you have now."
<0111> \{［Hope］}
<0112> "......"
<0113> \{［伶］}
<0114> "I'll tell you the details in my room,
<0115> \ For now, be quiet.
<0116> \ ...Did you understand?
<0117> \{［Hope］}
<0118> "...Yes..."
<0119> Upon hearing Rei's words, Nozomi relaxed her body as if giving up.
<0120> He slumped his shoulders and looked down sadly,
<0121> After that, he pursed his lips tightly and fell silent.
<0122> \{［伶］}
<0123> "...I'll take care of the rest.
<0124> \ You can step back now."
<0125> \{［Male］}
<0126> "Yes... Understood."
<0127> Leaving the man there, bowing deeply,
<0128> Rei pulled Nozomi's arm as she bit her lip and looked down.
<0129> With Marie beside him, who is quietly concerned about Nozomi,
<0130> The group heads to Nozomi's room.
<0131> \{［伶］}
<0132> "--Nozomi, what on earth is that commotion about?
<0133> \ I heard you tried to cross the garden boundary,
<0134> \ Why would you take such a risk?
<0135> Rei returns to the room with Nozomi.
<0136> I released my grip on Nozomi's arm and asked her a question.
<0137> Nozomi looked up as if she had been bounced off something,
<0138> He clung to Rei's chest with such intensity that it felt like he was about to collide with her.
<0139> Summoning his trembling voice, he pleaded desperately.
<0140> \{［Hope］}
<0141> "Please... help me...!"
<0142> \{［伶］}
<0143> "Help me?"
<0144> \{［Hope］}
<0145> "Please stop that Himei..."
<0146> \{［伶］}
<0147> "...screams?"
<0148> \{［Hope］}
<0149> "It hurts, and he's crying.
<0150> \ Please help that child...!
<0151> Surprised, I strained my ears,
<0152> The room was silent, not even a scream.
<0153> I can't even hear a whisper.
<0154> \{［伶］}
<0155> "--I can't hear anything."
<0156> \{［Hope］}
<0157> "I'm not lying!
<0158> \ ...Please...!"
<0159> \{［Hope］}
<0160> "...Someone...help that child..."
<0161> Finally, he couldn't bear it any longer,
<0162> Nozomi had her ears pressed tightly into her palms,
<0163> Like a marionette whose strings have been cut,
<0164> Wearily, I crouch down on the spot.
<0165> From behind her tightly closed thin eyelids,
<0166> Uncontrollable tears welled up,
<0167> Drops ran down my cheeks and fell to the floor.
<0168> \{［伶］}
<0169> "......"
<0170> Someone screams that Rei can't hear,
<0171> "I can hear you," he insisted.
<0172> Nozomi pleads for help, saying, "Please stop it."
<0173> Is Nozomi's claim actually true?
<0174> Or is this all an act by Nozomi to deceive Rei?
<0175> I stared at Nozomi's back, her head bowed and her shoulders shaking.
<0176> Rei ponders for a while.
<0177> Believe in the words of hope
<0178> Refuse Nozomi's request
<0179> \{［伶］}
<0180> "...I understand. If you say so,
<0181> \ I'll believe your words too."
<0182> \{［Hope］}
<0183> "Eh..."
<0184> \{［伶］}
<0185> "So, where should I go?
<0186> \ If you don't have time, hurry up.
<0187> \{［Hope］}
<0188> "Y-yes...!"
<0189> \{［伶］}
<0190> "Mari. You're trying to calm Nozomi down.
<0191> \ Please stay by my side."
<0192> \{[Mari]}
<0193> "Yes! Please leave this to me."
<0194> \{［伶］}
<0195> "I'm counting on you."
<0196> "I hear a cry for help..."
<0197> I headed in the direction Nozomi had told me,
<0198> In a corner of the garden, several men were standing in a circle.
<0199> I came across people cheering and having fun doing something.
<0200> I looked around but there was no one there except the men.
<0201> They were probably the ones Nozomi was talking about.
<0202> What are the men surrounding?
<0203> Although he was suspicious inside, he called out to them.
<0204> \{［伶］}
<0205> "--What are you guys doing there?"
<0206> \{［Male］}
<0207> "...! T-this is...thanks."
<0208> In response to Rei's sharp questioning voice,
<0209> The men who were surrounding something were laughing unpleasantly.
<0210> He stops moving and looks back at me in a panic.
<0211> \{［伶］}
<0212> "You guys... are in charge of security for this mansion.
<0213> \ It looks like a lot of fun,
<0214> \ What are you doing here, abandoning your duties?
<0215> \{［Male］}
<0216> "Well, that's... you see..."
<0217> \{［伶］}
<0218> "I don't want to hear any lame explanations.
<0219> \ I want you to tell me just the facts about what you were doing."
<0220> \{［Male］}
<0221> "Uh, yeah..."
<0222> The men looked at each other in confusion.
<0223> Rei urges him with a cold gaze.
<0224> They tried to force a troublesome role on me,
<0225> Rei's shins were watching the men exchanging glances,
<0226> Suddenly, something small, light and warm appeared.
<0227> It bumped into me.
<0228> \{［伶］}
<0229> "...?"
<0230> Surprised, I looked down at my feet,
<0231> It wags its little tail so hard it looks like it might fall off.
<0232> The brown Mameshiba puppy looked up at Rei as if pleading for help.
<0233> She rubbed her body against me with all her might.
<0234> \{［伶］}
<0235> "...A puppy? Is it the mansion's pet dog?"
<0236> \{［伶］}
<0237> "No. He's just a stray dog that wandered into the mansion."
<0238> \{［Male］}
<0239> "Um... this dog wandered in,
<0240> \ We were trying to get rid of this guy..."
<0241> \{［伶］}
<0242> "Disposalーwhat?"
<0243> If you look closely, you'll see that the puppy's body is very dirty.
<0244> There are several shoe prints and scuff marks visible.
<0245> Fortunately, there appear to be no fatal injuries,
<0246> Men treat puppies like toys,
<0247> I was trying to kick him to death for fun.
<0248> Now I understand.
<0249> In Rei's heart, she felt a deep resentment towards the men's cruel actions.
<0250> A cold rage rises up inside me.
<0251> \{［伶］}
<0252> "...a bunch of grown men gathered around me,
<0253> \ I can't believe you enjoy torturing such a small dog.
<0254> \ Aren't you ashamed of your actions?"
<0255> \{［伶］}
<0256> "If you're bored enough to play silly games,
<0257> \ I think we should consider relieving you of your duties.
<0258> \ I'll let Takami know that too."
<0259> \{［Male］}
<0260> "N-No way...! We just..."
<0261> \{［伶］}
<0262> "No excuses.
<0263> \ If you don't like that, then hurry back to your post.
<0264> \ Do your job as you should.
<0265> Exposed to Rei's piercingly cold gaze,
<0266> The men stood there, cowering in dejection,
<0267> At that word, everyone was pushing and shoving, trying to get in first.
<0268> He left the scene in a hurry.
<0269> \{［伶］}
<0270> "...Now, this is a problem."
<0271> Although it was a coincidence,
<0272> It seems that Rei has been forced to take care of him.
<0273> A puppy squealing and clinging to you,
<0274> I had no choice but to pick him up.
<0275> The puppy instinctively realized that Rei was on its side.
<0276> Without the slightest fear,
<0277> He picked up Rei and eagerly reached up to lick her cheek.
<0278> \{［伶］}
<0279> "Ahhh -- don't be so spoiled.
<0280> \ What should I do with you?
<0281> \ I'm really in trouble."
<0282> The round eyes of someone who doesn't understand what was said,
<0283> It doesn't seem like it belongs to a dog that was bullied by humans just a moment ago.
<0284> It shines with friendly affection.
<0285> It's no use trying to explain anything to such an innocent creature.
<0286> Rei sighs in resignation.
<0287> \{［伶］}
<0288> (...Nozomi said "help me"
<0289> \ Are you talking about this puppy...?
<0290> There were many things I wanted to ask Nozomi.
<0291> Why is hope so far away?
<0292> And the cry for help that came from a puppy, not a human,
<0293> Were you able to hear me?
<0294> \{［伶］}
<0295> "--But first,
<0296> \ After we sort out the issue regarding the puppy..."
<0297> When Rei returned to Nozomi's room with the puppy in her arms,
<0298> Before I could even reach the doorknob, the door was slammed open from inside.
<0299> It seems they were waiting for me to return.
<0300> Sensing Rei's presence, Nozomi opened the door before us.
<0301> \{［伶］}
<0302> "I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
<0303> \ Was it this puppy's life that you wanted to protect?
<0304> \{［desire］}
<0305> "Ah..."
<0306> I pulled away the puppy that was clinging to me, not wanting to let go.
<0307> Rei leaves it in Nozomi's care.
<0308> I gently accepted the puppy as if it were a treasure, and hugged it tightly.
<0309> When I rubbed my cheek against the short, soft fur,
<0310> Nozomi finally relaxed and nodded.
<0311> \{[Mari]}
<0312> "That's good for you, Nozomi."
<0313> \{［desire］}
<0314> "Yes...!"
<0315> \{［desire］}
<0316> "Himei... I can't hear you anymore..."
<0317> Burying her face in the puppy's brown fur,
<0318> Nozomi narrows her eyes in embarrassment and gives a small smile.
<0319> \{［伶］}
<0320> "By the way, what should I do with this dog?
<0321> \ We can't keep them in the mansion,
<0322> \ If we let it go like this, it will just get hunted by wild dogs."
<0323> \{［伶］}
<0324> "This is a problem..."
<0325> \{[Mari]}
<0326> "In that case, leave it to me.
<0327> \ I have one idea about where to take the puppy.
<0328> \{［伶］}
<0329> "To you...?"
<0330> \{[Mari]}
<0331> "Yes! It's a little ways from here,
<0332> \ An old couple who own a small ranch,
<0333> \ I've been on friendly terms with you for a while now."
<0334> \{[Mari]}
<0335> "Those people would be happy to take the puppy.
<0336> \ If Lady Rei would allow it,
<0337> \ I'll give you some time to leave it with you..."
<0338> \{［伶］}
<0339> "I see. Then I'll leave this matter to you.
<0340> \ Take the puppy somewhere safe."
<0341> \{[Mari]}
<0342> "Yes, I understand.
<0343> \ It's not that far to walk,
<0344> \ I'll leave in the afternoon."
<0345> \{［Hope］}
<0346> "...Ah..."
<0347> \{[Mari]}
<0348> "Nozomi-san..."
<0349> \{[Mari]}
<0350> "...I know it's hard to say goodbye,
<0351> \ Please leave it to me."
<0352> \{[Mari]}
<0353> "They are a very kind couple,
<0354> \ I'm sure you will raise this child with great care.
<0355> \ Therefore――」
<0356> \{［desire］}
<0357> "...I'll leave it to you..."
<0358> \{［Hope］}
<0359> "Rather than staying here,
<0360> \ I'm sure... that would be better..."
<0361> \{［desire］}
<0362> "Please..."
<0363> \{[Mari]}
<0364> "...Nozomi..."
<0365> As if reluctant to lose the warmth in my hands,
<0366> Nozomi closes her eyes and gently rubs her cheek against the puppy's head.
<0367> The puppy squints its eyes happily as it is hugged.
<0368> Like a child who depends on its mother,
<0369> He licks back Nozomi's white cheek with his small tongue.
<0370> It's as if she's laughing innocently,
<0371> A happy puppy's face.
<0372> \{［Hope］}
<0373> "...Goodbye..."
<0374> I let go of his cheek,
<0375> Nozomi takes a leap of faith and hands the puppy over to Marie.
<0376> I returned the encouraging smile,
<0377> Marie gently picked up the puppy and left the room.
<0378> Surprised at being separated from Nozomi,
<0379> Yawn yawn,
<0380> The puppy cries, making a sad, shrieking noise.
<0381> \{［Hope］}
<0382> "......"
<0383> Beyond the door, it gradually recedes into the distance,
<0384> The puppy's heartbreaking cry for Nozomi,
<0385> Nozomi remained silent and continued to listen.
<0386> Eventually, when the puppy's voice became less audible in the distance,
<0387> Nozomi suddenly let out a sigh of tension.
<0388> \{［伶］}
<0389> "...Was it okay if we didn't stop that noise?"
<0390> \{［Hope］}
<0391> "That's... not a painful voice..."
<0392> \{［伶］}
<0393> "I see..."
<0394> \{［伶］}
<0395> "......"
<0396> \{［伶］}
<0397> "--Nozomi, I want to tell you,
<0398> \ There's just one thing I want to ask you."
<0399> \{［伶］}
<0400> "Perhaps you can hear the inner voices of the speechless beasts,
<0401> \ Can't you feel it?
<0402> \{［desire］}
<0403> "...!"
<0404> \{［Hope］}
<0405> "No... that's not true...!"
<0406> \{［伶］}
<0407> "No, that's not true. You can't see it,
<0408> \ The screams of a puppy in the distance,
<0409> \ You were certainly listening then. -- Right?
<0410> \{［desire］}
<0411> "......!"
<0412> \{［伶］}
<0413> "But what you took there,
<0414> \ The reason for that mysterious behavior,
<0415> \ The results derived from this cannot be explained.
<0416> \{［Hope］}
<0417> "...Ah..."
<0418> \{［伶］}
<0419> "You've always done that,
<0420> \ Have you hidden this from anyone?
<0421> \ The "power" you possess--"
<0422> \{［desire］}
<0423> "......"
<0424> \{［Hope］}
<0425> "No one believes me..."
<0426> \{［伶］}
<0427> "...Right. That's true."
<0428> \{［伶］}
<0429> “--Nozomi”
<0430> \{［伶］}
<0431> "Youーyour power,
<0432> \ Can you even read people's thoughts?
<0433> \{［Hope］}
<0434> "No. ... I can't hear what people are thinking."
<0435> \{［伶］}
<0436> "...I see."
<0437> \{［Hope］}
<0438> "...Um..."
<0439> \{［Hope］}
<0440> "You believed my words.
<0441> \ Why?
<0442> \{［伶］}
<0443> "......"
<0444> He didn't seem to be lying.
<0445> I didn't believe it.
<0446> \{［伶］}
<0447> "It didn't seem like you were lying to me."
<0448> \{［desire］}
<0449> "......!"
<0450> \{［伶］}
<0451> "Well - yes,
<0452> \ The fact that I was able to hear the feelings of a puppy from so far away,
<0453> \ I was surprised, too..."
<0454> \{［伶］}
<0455> "If you can hear it like that all the time,
<0456> \ The world must be a noisy place for you."
<0457> \{［desire］}
<0458> "...No. It's not always like this...
<0459> \ The reason why I continued to hear such a distant voice even though it was so far away was
<0460> \ This is my first time..."
<0461> \{［伶］}
<0462> "So... normally you can't hear as well as you can today?"
<0463> \{［desire］}
<0464> "Yes..."
<0465> \{［desire］}
<0466> "......"
<0467> \{［伶］}
<0468> "...What's wrong? Can you still hear anything?"
<0469> \{［desire］}
<0470> "N-no! That's not what I meant!"
<0471> \{［伶］}
<0472> "But you still have something
<0473> \ You look like you haven't said enough yet, right?
<0474> \{［Hope］}
<0475> "Um... well, I'm glad you believed my words earlier.
<0476> \ Thank you so much...!
<0477> \{［Hope］}
<0478> "Thanks to your faith in me,
<0479> \ The puppy was saved."
<0480> \{［desire］}
<0481> "I'm truly grateful to you...!"
<0482> \{［伶］}
<0483> "Until now, have you ever told anyone about your "power"?
<0484> \ Have you never confided in anyone?
<0485> \ Was there no one around you who believed in your "power"?
<0486> \{［desire］}
<0487> "......"
<0488> \{［desire］}
<0489> "I've tried talking to him..."
<0490> \{［desire］}
<0491> "Like today... I hear a cry for help,
<0492> \ Please help me,
<0493> \ I have asked my uncle and aunt for help."
<0494> \{［伶］}
<0495> "So? How were your adoptive parents?"
<0496> \{［desire］}
<0497> "...You didn't believe a word I said.
<0498> \ She's a creepy kid who always says strange things..."
<0499> \{［Hope］}
<0500> "The one who believed in me was
<0501> \ You and... just one other person."
<0502> \{［伶］}
<0503> "Me andーone other person?
<0504> \ Are you related to the Kujo family, who raised you as your adoptive parents?
<0505> \{［Hope］}
<0506> "No... that's not it."
<0507> \{［伶］}
<0508> "So, are you from the mansion?"
<0509> \{［Hope］}
<0510> "...No."
<0511> \{［伶］}
<0512> "If he's not related to the Kujo family or from the mansion,
<0513> \ Who the hell are you and where are you from?
<0514> \{［Hope］}
<0515> "......"
<0516> \{［伶］}
<0517> "...It seems like you don't want to talk."
<0518> \{［伶］}
<0519> "In that case, I won't pry into anything now.
<0520> \ If you ever feel like talking, please let me know."
<0521> \{［Hope］}
<0522> "...I'm sorry..."
<0523> \{［伶］}
<0524> "I don't mind."
<0525> \{［伶］}
<0526> "...But even so,
<0527> \ The power to understand the minds of birds and animals that do not have words...
<0528> \ It's a very angelic power."
<0529> \{［Hope］}
<0530> "......!"
<0531> \{［伶］}
<0532> "...? What's wrong, Nozomi?
<0533> \ Your face is pretty red though."
<0534> \{［Hope］}
<0535> "Oh, well, it's nothing!"
<0536> \{［伶］}
<0537> "--?"
<0538> \{［伶］}
<0539> (Nozomi's "ability to hear the voices of birds and animals" is
<0540> \ I certify that this child is of Angelic blood,
<0541> \ Is it a "\ruby{sign}={sign}"?
<0542> \{［伶］}
<0543> (Although different in nature from me, there is a boy with mysterious powers - Asaba Nozomi.
<0544> The previous head of the Kujo family took a special liking to him,
<0545> \ Something that belongs to the Angels, hidden from everyone and raised in secret――)
<0546> \{［伶］}
<0547> (...Interesting. I'm becoming more and more interested.)
<0548> \{［伶］}
<0549> "Well, I'll be heading back soon.
<0550> \ If I feel like it, I'll come and see you again."
<0551> \{［desire］}
<0552> "Y-yes."
<0553> Just a little more than before,
<0554> I left Nozomi in the room with a happy look on her face.
<0555> Rei left the scene.
<0556> \{［伶］}
<0557> "I didn't believe a word you said.
<0558> \ I was just trying to calm you down for the time being."
<0559> \{［desire］}
<0560> "Is that so...?"
<0561> He looked extremely disappointed,
<0562> When Nozomi dropped her gaze to her feet,
<0563> The conversation there comes to a sudden halt.
<0564> And from then on, no matter what Rei asked,
<0565> Nozomi stopped answering.
<0566> Realizing that there was no point in wasting any more time,
<0567> I had no choice but to leave Nozomi's room.
<0568> \{［伶］}
<0569> "--I can't do what you ask.
<0570> \ There is a possibility that you are planning to escape,
<0571> \ It can't be said to be zero."
<0572> \{［Hope］}
<0573> "...Uh..."
<0574> Nozomi's shoulders trembled at Rei's words.
<0575> Tears pattering down,
<0576> On the polished floor,
<0577> Creates a dark stain, like a ripple that never fades.
<0578> Rei just stared at the scene in silence.
<0579> \{［伶］}
<0580> "...Mariie"
<0581> \{[Mari]}
<0582> "Y-Yes!"
<0583> \{［伶］}
<0584> "You too, don't get involved with Nozomi. Good."
<0585> \{[Mari]}
<0586> "...Yes. Understood."
<0587> I didn't respond to their words,
<0588> Rei left the room with Marie following behind.
<0589> After leaving the room, we walked down the hallway in silence for a while,
<0590> Marie was walking discreetly behind him.
<0591> I spoke to Rei in a hesitant voice.
<0592> \{[Mari]}
<0593> "Nozomi-san, how desperate you were... I'm worried."
<0594> \{［伶］}
<0595> "......"
<0596> \{[Mari]}
<0597> "I... I wonder if Nozomi is planning something,
<0598> \ It's as if he's lying and trying to deceive Rei-sama.
<0599> \ I couldn't see it at all..."
<0600> \{[Mari]}
<0601> "Somethingーsome special circumstances,
<0602> \ Perhaps Nozomi-san had one...?
<0603> \{［伶］}
<0604> "...You're probably right."
<0605> \{［伶］}
<0606> "Either way, I didn't believe Nozomi.
<0607> \ ...It's all over now.
<0608> \ I would like you not to bring up this matter any further.
<0609> \{[Mari]}
<0610> "Yes... I'm sorry..."
<0611> \{[Mari]}
<0612> "Umm, actually..."
<0613> \{[Mari]}
<0614> "Nozomi-san, I heard you're not feeling well.
<0615> \ I didn't eat anything this morning,
<0616> \ He is resting in his room.
<0617> \{［伶］}
<0618> "Well, how is your health?
<0619> \ I'll go and check it out."
<0620> \{[Mari]}
<0621> "Yes! I look forward to working with you."
<0622> Still unaware of what happened between Rei and Nozomi,
<0623> Rei left the dining room, sent off by Marie's carefree words.
<0624> When Rei went to Nozomi's room,
<0625> A large man in black clothes stood in front of the door.
<0626> --That's a familiar face.
<0627> I'm pretty sure he was a man in the department in charge of security at the mansion.
<0628> Feeling suspicious, I approached and called out to him.
<0629> \{［伶］}
<0630> "What are you doing in a place like this?
<0631> \ What about Nozomi? Is she in her room?
<0632> \{［Male］}
<0633> "Yes, that's it... Actually, the product I just mentioned,
<0634> \ He was trying to escape and cross the garden boundary.
<0635> \{［伶］}
<0636> "Nozomi tried to escape...?
<0637> \ That's a hard story to believe. So, what about Nozomi?
<0638> \{［Male］}
<0639> "We caught them when we found them and put them inside..."
<0640> \{［Male］}
<0641> "When I caught him, he struggled and resisted,
<0642> \ I locked the door to prevent them from escaping and kept watch here.
<0643> \ It seems to have calmed down and become quieter now."
<0644> I looked down at the man's words,
<0645> It can only be opened and closed from the outside.
<0646> It is only installed in the Nozomi room in this mansion.
<0647> The simple door lock was closed.
<0648> Usually, Nozomi doesn't resist, so it's not used,
<0649> In such an emergency,
<0650> It is used to keep the commodity under house arrest.
<0651> \{［伶］}
<0652> "...I'll try talking to you. Get out of the way.
<0653> \ You can step back now."
<0654> \{［Male］}
<0655> "Huh..."
<0656> \{［伶］}
<0657> "Nozomi, it's me. I'm coming in."
<0658> I stood in front of the door the man had left and knocked lightly several times,
<0659> Rei unlocked the door and opened it.
<0660> Stepping into the room, Nozomi looked around and saw someone crouching in the corner like a frightened animal protecting itself.
<0661> I found her trembling with her small body.
<0662> Nozomi closed her eyes tightly,
<0663> With both ears firmly pressed under the palms of your hands,
<0664> He bites his lip and trembles silently.
<0665> \{［伶］}
<0666> "Nozomi... what's wrong?"
<0667> Be careful not to stimulate it too much.
<0668> Rei called out softly,
<0669> Nozomi's shoulders twitched in response to the call.
<0670> \{［伶］}
<0671> "I heard you tried to escape, but it's hard to believe.
<0672> \ What on earth happened, Nozomi?
<0673> \{［desire］}
<0674> "......"
<0675> Nozomi listens to Rei's quiet words,
<0676> Without opening his tightly closed lips,
<0677> He covers his ears without giving any explanation.
<0678> From behind her tightly closed thin eyelids,
<0679> Uncontrollable tears welled up,
<0680> Drops ran down my cheeks and fell to the floor.
<0681> \{［伶］}
<0682> "Nozomi... what are you lamenting?
<0683> \ Can you tell me?"
<0684> \{［desire］}
<0685> "......"
<0686> Even after Rei called out again,
<0687> I simply shook my head a few times to show my refusal.
<0688> Nozomi remains silent and refuses to speak.
<0689> --Nozomi finds out something that Rei doesn't know,
<0690> He seemed extremely despairing about that.
<0691> What on earth could have caused Nozomi to lament so much?
<0692> After that, Rei asked him about the situation many times, but
<0693> Nozomi remained stubbornly silent,
<0694> He never tried to tell Rei the reason for his tears.
<0695> If Nozomi doesn't speak her mind,
<0696> To comfort hope, to extend a helping hand,
<0697> There is nothing I can do for Rei.
<0698> But that's not surprising.
<0699> For Nozomi, Rei is the one to whom he can confide his worries.
<0700> There's something unfamiliar and distant about it.
<0701> Even for Rei, Nozomi's heart is so far away that it is difficult for her to understand it.
<0702> In the end, there was nothing more that could be done.
<0703> Leaving Nozomi in the room, her shoulders shaking and sobbing,
<0704> I had no choice but to leave the place.
<0705> \{［伶］}
<0706> "That's right... in the morning,
<0707> \ I don't really feel like meeting anyone..."
<0708> \{［伶］}
<0709> "Just like last time, I walked around the building lightly,
<0710> \ I'm going back to my room."
<0711> \{[Mari]}
<0712> "I understand. Well then, I'll leave it at that..."
<0713> After bowing and saying goodbye,
<0714> Marie quietly left the room.
<0715> After slowly drinking tea after dinner,
<0716> Rei got up from her seat to go for a walk around the mansion.
<0717> As Rei strolled around the building,
<0718> I came across a strange sight.
<0719> He looked around hesitantly,
<0720> I see Marie heading towards the courtyard.
<0721> Tracking down Marie
<0722> I don't care
<0723> Rei was curious about what Marie was doing.
<0724> I decided to follow him.
<0725> Carrying a package of some kind,
<0726> Marie carefully looked around her surroundings several times,
<0727> I make my way into the bushes in the courtyard.
<0728> Across the terrace and courtyard,
<0729> Marie goes further into the corner of the garden.
<0730> \{［伶］}
<0731> "...?"
<0732> What on earth could be in a place like this?
<0733> Rei follows after him, though she is skeptical.
<0734> \{[Mari]}
<0735> "...Sorry to keep you waiting."
<0736> Marie's voice came into my ears, talking to someone.
<0737> Rei couldn't help but narrow her eyes.
<0738> Marie crouched on the ground,
<0739> Who is speaking into the depths of the bushes?
<0740> Rei squinted her eyes and saw――
<0741> There, Marie was seen feeding a puppy.
<0742> A brown Mameshiba puppy wagged its tail vigorously.
<0743> Eating food taken from the package prepared by Marie.
<0744> \{[Mari]}
<0745> "You must have been hungry."
<0746> \{[Mari]}
<0747> "These are leftovers from the kitchen.
<0748> \ This bone-in meat is probably delicious...!
<0749> Marie was talking gently to the puppy,
<0750> Rei called out softly.
<0751> \{［伶］}
<0752> "...Mari-e"
<0753> \{[Mari]}
<0754> "Aaaaahhh...!!"
<0755> \{[Mari]}
<0756> "Rei-sama?!"
<0757> \{［伶］}
<0758> "What are you doing in a place like that?
<0759> \ What about that puppy...?
<0760> \{[Mari]}
<0761> "Um, well, this is..."
<0762> \{［伶］}
<0763> "......"
<0764> \{[Mari]}
<0765> "This dog is... a stray dog.
<0766> \ It seems that he recently entered the mansion grounds..."
<0767> \{[Mari]}
<0768> "So, um..."
<0769> \{［伶］}
<0770> "You are hiding from everyone in the mansion,
<0771> \ You were feeding a puppy... right?
<0772> \{[Mari]}
<0773> "Y-yes! Sorry...!"
<0774> Blaming Marie
<0775> Forgive Marie
<0776> \{［伶］}
<0777> "I don't think it's a good idea for you to do this on your own.
<0778> \ You haven't reported this to your superiors, have you?
<0779> \{[Mari]}
<0780> "Yes..."
<0781> \{[Mari]}
<0782> "They'll probably be disposed of..."
<0783> \{[Mari]}
<0784> "Yesterday, when I found
<0785> \ The child was very weak..."
<0786> \{[Mari]}
<0787> "So, at least until I get better...
<0788> \ I fed them without permission."
<0789> \{［伶］}
<0790> "......"
<0791> \{[Mari]}
<0792> "I'm sorry for acting on your own...!"
<0793> \{［伶］}
<0794> "...Well, it's fine. It's just a harmless looking puppy.
<0795> \ I don't have any particular intention to punish you either."
<0796> \{［伶］}
<0797> "Do as you like."
<0798> \{[Mari]}
<0799> "Yes...! Thank you!"
<0800> With a relieved look on her face, Marie hugged the puppy.
<0801> \{［伶］}
<0802> "However, it would probably be a bad idea to keep it in the mansion.
<0803> \ You'd better do something quickly."
<0804> \{[Mari]}
<0805> "Um... actually, I have a hunch.
<0806> \ Today, I'm going to someone who might be interested in adopting a puppy.
<0807> \ I was planning to go out.
<0808> \{[Mari]}
<0809> "A little way from here,
<0810> \ An old couple who own a small ranch,
<0811> \ I've been on friendly terms with you for a while now."
<0812> \{[Mari]}
<0813> "Those people,
<0814> \ I'm sure they'll adopt the puppy."
<0815> \{[Mari]}
<0816> "The ranch is not that far away to walk to,
<0817> \ I'll leave in the afternoon."
<0818> \{［伶］}
<0819> "I see. Then I'll leave the rest to you."
<0820> \{[Mari]}
<0821> "Yes, I understand!"
<0822> \{[Mari]}
<0823> "Umm, Rei-sama... thank you!"
<0824> Leaving Marie there, holding the puppy,
<0825> Rei left the terrace.
<0826> \{［伶］}
<0827> "...Well, it's fine. It's just a harmless looking puppy.
<0828> \ I don't have any particular intention of punishing you either."
<0829> \{［伶］}
<0830> "Do as you like."
<0831> \{[Mari]}
<0832> "Th...Thank you...!"
<0833> With a relieved look on her face, Marie hugged the puppy.
<0834> \{［伶］}
<0835> "But, how can I put it, that's typical of you.
<0836> \ I wonder what you're doing secretly..."
<0837> Rei couldn't help but smile.
<0838> \{[Mari]}
<0839> "I... did something like this without thinking...!
<0840> \ I'm so sorry...!
<0841> \{［伶］}
<0842> "You say you're the type of person who can't leave a stray dog alone,
<0843> \ I understand.
<0844> \ I guess it can't be helped, given your personality."
<0845> \{［伶］}
<0846> "However, it's still not a good idea to keep them in the mansion.
<0847> \ We'd better do something."
<0848> \{[Mari]}
<0849> "Um... actually, I have a hunch.
<0850> In the afternoon, I went to see someone who might be interested in adopting the puppy.
<0851> \ I was planning on going out."
<0852> \{[Mari]}
<0853> "A little way from here,
<0854> \ An old couple who own a small ranch,
<0855> \ I've been on friendly terms with you for a while now."
<0856> \{[Mari]}
<0857> "Those people,
<0858> \ I'm sure they'll adopt the puppy."
<0859> \{[Mari]}
<0860> "The ranch is not that far away to walk to,
<0861> \ I'll leave in the afternoon."
<0862> \{［伶］}
<0863> "I see..."
<0864> \{［伶］}
<0865> "I don't have any plans for the afternoon.
<0866> \ As long as you're okay,
<0867> \ And I don't mind if I accompany you?
<0868> \{[Mari]}
<0869> "Huh?! Um, I'm fine, but
<0870> \ Are you sure...?
<0871> \{［伶］}
<0872> "Yeah. Sounds like a good way to kill time.
<0873> \ Besides, I don't really dislike dogs that much either."
<0874> \{[Mari]}
<0875> "Rei-sama... thank you!"
<0876> \{［伶］}
<0877> "...Then let's go out after lunch."
<0878> \{[Mari]}
<0879> "Yes! Understood."
<0880> \{[Mari]}
<0881> "That's great...!
<0882> \ Now I feel completely at ease about the puppy."
<0883> On the way back from the ranch run by the elderly couple who had entrusted the puppy to me,
<0884> Rei and Marie,
<0885> We walked slowly, shoulder to shoulder, through the deserted forest.
<0886> \{［伶］}
<0887> "How long have you known that old couple?"
<0888> \{[Mari]}
<0889> "There is a spring nearby where I can draw water,
<0890> \ I often meet you on the street,
<0891> \ We exchanged greetings."
<0892> \{[Mari]}
<0893> "Under those people, that puppy would also
<0894> \ I'm sure you'll be able to live a relaxed life...!"
<0895> \{[Mari]}
<0896> "But... hehe. That puppy,
<0897> \ Even though it was only a short time, you really grew attached to Rei-sama."
<0898> \{［伶］}
<0899> "...I guess so. I don't think that's the case."
<0900> \{[Mari]}
<0901> "Finally, in a very sad voice,
<0902> \ I've been calling out to you, Rei-sama..."
<0903> \{［伶］}
<0904> "......"
<0905> \{[Mari]}
<0906> "After all, animals have instincts,
<0907> \ I can see that Rei-sama is a kind person."
<0908> \{［伶］}
<0909> "...I'm not a good person."
<0910> \{[Mari]}
<0911> "No, Rei-sama is a kind person.
<0912> \ I know that too!
<0913> Marie walks next to Rei, smiling brightly.
<0914> It feels a little uncomfortable.
<0915> And yet it was a heartwarming moment.
<0916> When I'm around Marie, my heart mysteriously becomes brighter.
<0917> Rei noticed the change in herself.
<0918> Marie's cheerfulness is by no means insensitive liveliness,
<0919> He was sensitive and considerate of those around him.
<0920> Perhaps that's what Rei likes about it.
<0921> Suddenly, Rei asks Marie about life at the mansion.
<0922> I thought I'd ask.
<0923> \{［伶］}
<0924> "By the way... Marie, I have a few things for you.
<0925> \ Is it okay if I ask a question?
<0926> \{[Mari]}
<0927> "Yes, please!"
<0928> \{［伶］}
<0929> "What do you think about living in that mansion?"
<0930> \{[Mari]}
<0931> "Working at the mansion... I really like it."
<0932> \{[Mari]}
<0933> "I clean the mansion, take care of the plants in the garden,
<0934> \ Making tea for my master..."
<0935> \{[Mari]}
<0936> "I'm still inexperienced,
<0937> \ I'm sorry for causing trouble to everyone around me,
<0938> \ Every day is very fulfilling.
<0939> \{[Mari]}
<0940> "I hope that my body can be of use to someone.
<0941> \ I am so happy!
<0942> \{［伶］}
<0943> "I see..."
<0944> \{［伶］}
<0945> "By the way, does Takami ever treat you harshly?"
<0946> \{[Mari]}
<0947> "That's not true at all...!"
<0948> \{[Mari]}
<0949> "Mr. Takami, you have told us servants,
<0950> \ They are very kind to me."
<0951> \{[Mari]}
<0952> "Takami-sama... he can be a little quick to anger,
<0953> \ Just like Rei-sama,
<0954> \ I think you are a very kind person at heart."
<0955> \{［伶］}
<0956> "...When you're like that,
<0957> \ Honestly, I'm surprised you mentioned Takami."
<0958> \{[Mari]}
<0959> "Is that so? Takami-sama is very dedicated to his work,
<0960> \ He's a serious person."
<0961> \{[Mari]}
<0962> "We want to make it easier for Nozomi to spend time at the mansion,
<0963> \ They've been very considerate."
<0964> \{[Mari]}
<0965> "But, Nozomi... you've been depressed in this mansion for a long time,
<0966> \ We rarely,
<0967> \ You will never see Nozomi-san's smile again."
<0968> \{[Mari]}
<0969> "If this continues... Nozomi-san,
<0970> \ I think you might get sick..."
<0971> \{［伶］}
<0972> "Nozomi..."
<0973> \{［伶］}
<0974> "To be honest, I told her,
<0975> \ I'm not particularly interested in it..."
<0976> \{［伶］}
<0977> "What do those kids enjoy every day?
<0978> \ I guess you're spending your time here."
<0979> \{[Mari]}
<0980> "......"
<0981> \{[Mari]}
<0982> "Nozomi always goes to the bathroom at night.
<0983> \ She's by the window watching the stars."
<0984> \{［伶］}
<0985> “Star?”
<0986> \{[Mari]}
<0987> "When I was a child, I loved looking at the stars.
<0988> \ There was a time when I used to look at the starry sky from the window every night.
<0989> \{[Mari]}
<0990> "It's so beautiful even when viewed from the window,
<0991> \ Looking up at the starry sky outdoors,
<0992> \ I thought how wonderful it would be."
<0993> \{[Mari]}
<0994> "But I was often sick,
<0995> \ I wasn't allowed to go outside..."
<0996> \{[Mari]}
<0997> "So, I also understand Nozomi's feelings,
<0998> \ I think I understand..."
<0999> I ask if you still like stars.
<1000> Say nothing
<1001> \{［伶］}
<1002> "Do you still like the stars?"
<1003> \{[Mari]}
<1004> "Yes, I love it!"
<1005> \{[Mari]}
<1006> "Now, for work,
<1007> \ I can't go out at night though..."
<1008> \{[Mari]}
<1009> "Even today, outdoor astronomical observations are
<1010> \ It's one of my dreams since I was a child!
<1011> \{［伶］}
<1012> "...I see. Then I will give you special permission,
<1013> \ Shall we go outside and look at the stars tonight?
<1014> \{[Mari]}
<1015> "What...?!"
<1016> \{［伶］}
<1017> "Listening to you,
<1018> \ I also feel like going outside to see the stars for the first time in a while.
<1019> \{［伶］}
<1020> "It's just a whimsical idea, but sometimes it's nice to have something like that.
<1021> \ I thought it might be interesting."
<1022> \{[Mari]}
<1023> "...Um, are you sure you want me to do this?"
<1024> \{[Mari]}
<1025> "The person who invited Takami-sama and Nozomi-san,
<1026> \ I think you'll be pleased...!
<1027> \{［伶］}
<1028> "...Right now, I would not make such an invitation to Takami or Nozomi.
<1029> \ I don't feel like calling.
<1030> \ I'm inviting you because it's you, right?
<1031> \{[Mari]}
<1032> "...!"
<1033> \{［伶］}
<1034> "Or do you not want to spend time with me, Marie?"
<1035> \{[Mari]}
<1036> "...No, not at all!"
<1037> \{[Mari]}
<1038> "Um, I'd love that...!
<1039> \ I'm so happy...!!"
<1040> \{[Mari]}
<1041> "I was so upset,
<1042> \ My mind went blank..."
<1043> \{[Mari]}
<1044> “This isn’t a dream… Ouch!
<1045> \ Um... it seems to be okay..."
<1046> Seeing Marie pinch her cheek to check,
<1047> Rei couldn't help but laugh.
<1048> \{［伶］}
<1049> "Interesting, you..."
<1050> \{[Mari]}
<1051> "Is that so...?
<1052> \ I'm always serious..."
<1053> \{［伶］}
<1054> "...Do you mind if I'm around?"
<1055> \{[Mari]}
<1056> "No, not at all...!
<1057> \ Thank you very much!
<1058> \{[Mari]}
<1059> "To an inexperienced servant like me,
<1060> \ Such thoughtfulness...
<1061> \ Thank you so much...!
<1062> \{［伶］}
<1063> "...It's not something worth thanking you for."
<1064> \{［伶］}
<1065> "So, after dinner,
<1066> \ Let's have some tea and then go outside for a while."
<1067> \{[Mari]}
<1068> "Y-yes!"
<1069> \{［伶］}
<1070> "......"
<1071> However, there was nothing in particular to say to Marie,
<1072> Rei kept her mouth shut.
<1073> \{[Mari]}
<1074> "The mansion is finally in sight...!"
<1075> The two of them just like that,
<1076> While we were chatting about nothing special,
<1077> I followed the path to the mansion.
<1078> The evening twilight passes in the blink of an eye,
<1079> After Rei stayed at this mansion at Takami's invitation,
<1080> The fourth night came.
<1081> Nothing particularly unusual happened that night.
<1082> The days passed quietly and calmly.
<1083> Rei was spending her time in her room, absentmindedly reading a book.
<1084> After taking a warm shower in the shower room,
<1085> Go to bed without staying up too late.
<1086> I turn off the soft light in the room and close my eyes,
<1087> Soon I was immersed in a deep sleep.
<1088> I wasn't particularly interested in Marie's actions.
<1089> Rei left the place in silence.
<1090> When Rei returned to her room, she spent the time until lunchtime.
<1091> I spent the day holed up in my room reading books.
<1092> \{［伶］}
<1093> "Just like last time, I walked around the building lightly,
<1094> \ I'm going back to my room."
<1095> \{[Mari]}
<1096> "I understand. Well then, I'll leave it at that..."
<1097> I bowed my head and said goodbye,
<1098> Marie quietly left the room.
<1099> After slowly drinking tea after dinner,
<1100> Rei got up from her seat to go for a walk around the mansion.
<1101> As Rei strolled around the building,
<1102> I came across a strange sight.
<1103> He looked around hesitantly,
<1104> I see Marie heading towards the courtyard.
<1105> However, he wasn't particularly interested in Marie's actions.
<1106> Rei left the place in silence.
<1107> When Rei returned to her room, she spent the time until lunchtime.
<1108> I spent the day holed up in my room reading books.
<1109> \{［伶］}
<1110> "The weather seems to be pretty good this morning.
<1111> \ Since I had the chance, I decided to take a morning walk.
<1112> \ I think I'll take a look around a bit."
<1113> \{[Mari]}
<1114> "That's right. The sun isn't too strong yet,
<1115> \ The air is clear,
<1116> \ It's a good time for a walk!
<1117> \{[Mari]}
<1118> "If you don't mind, I'd like to recommend a nice walking course around here.
<1119> \ I will introduce you to Rei-sama,
<1120> \ Why don't you take your time looking around until around noon?
<1121> \{［伶］}
<1122> "Yes, that would be good."
<1123> \{[Mari]}
<1124> "--Ah! I've got a great idea!"
<1125> \{[Mari]}
<1126> "Umm, I have a suggestion for you, Rei-sama.
<1127> \ The plan to take a walk with Takami-sama,
<1128> \ What do you think?
<1129> \{［伶］}
<1130> "No... I don't think that far..."
<1131> \{[Mari]}
<1132> "It may be nice to stroll around alone,
<1133> \ Walking in the forest with someone,
<1134> \ I think it's a fun and refreshing change of pace!
<1135> Go see Takami
<1136> I prefer being alone
<1137> \{［伶］}
<1138> "...I understand. While you're out and about,
<1139> \ I'll go and see Takami."
<1140> \{[Mari]}
<1141> "I see, that's good...!
<1142> \ I'm sure Takami-sama will be pleased!
<1143> \{[Mari]}
<1144> "--Ah, Rei-sama, please wait just a moment!"
<1145> \{［伶］}
<1146> "Hey... Marie?"
<1147> Leaving Rei where she is,
<1148> Marie hurriedly ran down the hallway.
<1149> I hesitated to go out like that,
<1150> I have no choice but to wait for Marie to return.
<1151> \{[Mari]}
<1152> "--Sorry to keep you waiting, Rei-sama!"
<1153> After a while, someone came carrying some kind of luggage.
<1154> Marie came back in a hurry.
<1155> When Rei sees what Marie is holding, she has a bad feeling.
<1156> \{[Mari]}
<1157> "Yes! Please take this!"
<1158> \{［伶］}
<1159> "...What is this?"
<1160> \{[Mari]}
<1161> "I baked it two weeks ago and left it to rest until today.
<1162> \ Dried fruit cake soaked in liquor!
<1163> \ Nuts and almonds, raisins and apricots..."
<1164> \{[Mari]}
<1165> "Well, anyway, it's got a lot of dried fruit in it,
<1166> \ It's quite filling.
<1167> \ When I served it as a snack, everyone at the mansion loved it."
<1168> \{[Mari]}
<1169> "In this pot,
<1170> \ It contains well-chilled iced tea.
<1171> \ If you're thirsty, drink some.
<1172> \{[Mari]}
<1173> "I remember that Takami-sama liked sweet things.
<1174> \ I remember.
<1175> \ Please enjoy it for both of you."
<1176> A small hand-held basket that can be held in one hand.
<1177> Marie forcefully handed Rei over to her.
<1178> My shoulders slumped in disappointment as my premonition came true.
<1179> \{［伶］}
<1180> "Wait a moment, Marie!
<1181> \ Are you sure you want me to take this?"
<1182> \{[Mari]}
<1183> "Yes! Please join me, Takami-sama!"
<1184> \{［伶］}
<1185> "......"
<1186> \{[Mari]}
<1187> "Well then, have a nice trip, Rei-sama.
<1188> \ Be careful!
<1189> Pushed by the innocent, happy smile,
<1190> I don't need this kind of thing,
<1191> In the end, I couldn't bring myself to coldly refuse.
<1192> Marie sees Rei off as she leaves the mansion.
<1193> The gentle mountain path leading from the mansion
<1194> I continued walking for about fifteen minutes without any particular hurry.
<1195> We soon arrived at the annex we were aiming for.
<1196> Rei rang the doorbell to announce her visit,
<1197> I was shown into Takami's room without having to wait.
<1198> \{[Takami]}
<1199> "You really... came to see me again today."
<1200> \{［伶］}
<1201> "I told you you could come if you were bored.
<1202> \ I decided to take you up on your offer. ...Was it a bother?
<1203> \{[Takami]}
<1204> "No. I was the one who brought it up, so I'll take responsibility."
<1205> \{[Takami]}
<1206> "By the way -- what is that?
<1207> \ You're carrying something that doesn't really suit you..."
<1208> Rei pointed to the basket she was holding in one hand,
<1209> Takami asked with a puzzled look on his face.
<1210> \{［伶］}
<1211> "...These are sweets handed to me by Marie.
<1212> \ I was forced to have it because you like sweet things.
<1213> \{［伶］}
<1214> "I brought it all the way here,
<1215> \ I'll make sure you eat this, okay?
<1216> \{[Takami]}
<1217> "Ah, ah..."
<1218> \{［伶］}
<1219> "Then I'll leave this to you."
<1220> Taking advantage of this opportunity, he pushed the basket he was holding towards Takami,
<1221> Then Rei finally breathed a sigh of relief.
<1222> Takami was staring at the basket with a troubled look on his face.
<1223> A slightly malicious thought pops into Rei's head.
<1224> \{［伶］}
<1225> "Right -- you just said you'd take responsibility for me, right?
<1226> \ Well then, I suppose you should keep your promise."
<1227> \{[Takami]}
<1228> "Wh... What's that!? That person's evil smile...!"
<1229> \{［伶］}
<1230> "Takami, I want you to hold that basket.
<1231> \ I'll have you join me on my walk."
<1232> \{[Takami]}
<1233> "Eh...! Something like this, me?
<1234> \ Are you going to carry it around?
<1235> \{［伶］}
<1236> "You'll keep your promise, right Takami?"
<1237> \{[Takami]}
<1238> "......"
<1239> \{[Takami]}
<1240> "...I can't win against you.
<1241> \ Okay, I'll go along with it.
<1242> \ By the way, where were you planning to go?
<1243> \{［伶］}
<1244> "I don't have any particular destination in mind, but..."
<1245> \{[Takami]}
<1246> "......"
<1247> \{[Takami]}
<1248> "If you have no hope,
<1249> \ I'll show you around, so why don't you take a walk through the forest?
<1250> That's not bad either.
<1251> I'll stop
<1252> \{［伶］}
<1253> "No... I'll stop.
<1254> \ I have accomplished my purpose for coming here,
<1255> \ That's fine, I'll call it a day."
<1256> \{[Takami]}
<1257> "...I see."
<1258> \{［伶］}
<1259> "Oh? You look very disappointed, Takami.
<1260> \ I wonder if I was rude to refuse."
<1261> \{［伶］}
<1262> "That's how much you've been doing with this basket in your hand.
<1263> \ I didn't think I wanted to walk through the forest.
<1264> \ --You have an unexpected taste for girls, don't you?
<1265> \{[Takami]}
<1266> "There's no way that's true!
<1267> \ That's enough, if you're done with your business, just go home now!
<1268> I said goodbye to Takami, who looked dissatisfied and sulky.
<1269> Rei then left the annex.
<1270> Rei left Takami and went straight back to the mansion.
<1271> After finishing my meal, I went back to my room.
<1272> I spent the whole day absorbed in sorting through the library.
<1273> \{［伶］}
<1274> "No, I refuse. I'm more comfortable being alone.
<1275> \ I won't go to Takami's place.
<1276> \{[Mari]}
<1277> "Is that so--"
<1278> \{[Mari]}
<1279> "Um, I'm sorry, Rei-sama.
<1280> \ I strongly recommend it..."
<1281> \{[Mari]}
<1282> "Well then, have a nice trip!
<1283> \ Please be careful..."
<1284> Rei leaves the mansion with Marie seeing her off.
<1285> The gentle road leading from the mansion,
<1286> I continued walking without any particular hurry, going through the nearby forest.
<1287> While resting my eyes on the vivid green of the trees,
<1288> Breathing in the pale blue forest air, full of ozone,
<1289> Rei enjoyed walking freely alone to her heart's content.
<1290> After that, I stopped walking at a suitable place,
<1291> Rei returned straight to the mansion,
<1292> After finishing my meal, I retired to my room,
<1293> I spent the whole day absorbed in sorting through the library.
<1294> Marie sees Rei off as she leaves the mansion.
<1295> Suddenly, I decided to stretch my legs a little,
<1296> I felt like dropping by Takami's place.
<1297> The gentle mountain path leading from the mansion
<1298> I walked for about fifteen minutes without any particular hurry.
<1299> Rei arrived at the annex she was aiming for.
<1300> It was used as one of the designs to decorate the gate.
<1301> When I rang the somewhat old-fashioned doorbell,
<1302> Soon, a dry female servant voice asks Rei.
<1303> \{[Servant]}
<1304> 『Who is this...?』
<1305> \{［伶］}
<1306> "It's Saiga. Is Takami there?"
<1307> \{[Servant]}
<1308> “No. Master is out today.
<1309> \ Would you like to leave a message?
<1310> \{［伶］}
<1311> "--No. I don't mind."
<1312> Rei left Takami and went straight back to the mansion.
<1313> After finishing my meal, I went back to my room,
<1314> I spent the whole day absorbed in sorting through the library.
<1315> \{［伶］}
<1316> "From now on? That's right... I have a book I'm reading,
<1317> \ I'm going back to my room."
<1318> Rei then spent the time until lunch,
<1319> I spent the day holed up in my room reading books.
