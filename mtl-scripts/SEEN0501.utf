<0000> May 5th Marie Route
<0001> From afar,
<0002> He keeps hearing voices calling out to him.
<0003> He first noticed the voice when
<0004> This happened when I was much younger than I am now.
<0005> Until then, he had never known such a voice existed.
<0006> Since when had this voice been calling out to him?
<0007> He just didn't notice it existed.
<0008> The voice has been there for a long timeーfor a long time,
<0009> Perhaps I had been calling him that for a long time.
<0010> Whose voice is it?
<0011> And what does this voice call to him?
<0012> ...I don't know.
<0013> The voice calling is far away,
<0014> Because they won't tell him anything.
<0015> Soon, a vision unfolded before his eyes.
<0016> Darkness and silence.
<0017> And darkness again.
<0018> - Darkness.
<0019> \{[Mari]}
<0020> "...Rei-sama...hello...?"
<0021> \{[Mari]}
<0022> "Um, Rei-sama?
<0023> \ Are you awake...?
<0024> \{[Mari]}
<0025> "Rei-sama...?"
<0026> A voice asks if you've woken up,
<0027> Gently, like a gentle breeze hitting the surface,
<0028> He gently calls out to Rei.
<0029> \{[Rei]}
<0030> "…………Is that you?"
<0031> \{[Mari]}
<0032> "Oh, are you awake?
<0033> \ Good morning, Rei-sama.
<0034> \{[Rei]}
<0035> "Ah... Good morning."
<0036> \{[Mari]}
<0037> "Um, Rei-sama, are you okay?
<0038> \ You don't seem to be feeling well..."
<0039> \{[Mari]}
<0040> "Rei-sama, there was what happened yesterday,
<0041> \ If you are not feeling well,
<0042> \ Why don't you just take a break for today?
<0043> \{[Rei]}
<0044> "No, nothing's wrong. I'll wake up."
<0045> \{[Mari]}
<0046> "Please don't push yourself too hard..."
<0047> \{[Rei]}
<0048> "Oh, I'll keep that in mind.
<0049> \ More importantly, the fact that you came to wake me up means
<0050> \ Have you come to call me to breakfast?
<0051> \{[Mari]}
<0052> "Oh, yes, that's right!
<0053> \ Breakfast is ready,
<0054> \ Would you like to have dinner?
<0055> \{[Rei]}
<0056> "Yes, I'll take it."
<0057> After breakfast, I went to bed, which has become a habit for me recently.
<0058> Time to enjoy the aroma of tea,
<0059> The party ends when the tilted cup is empty.
<0060> \{[Mari]}
<0061> "Rei-sama, what are your plans for today?"
<0062> \{[Rei]}
<0063> "That's right... Marie,
<0064> \ What are your plans for the future?
<0065> \{[Mari]}
<0066> "My plans...?"
<0067> \{[Mari]}
<0068> "In the morning, in the orchard on the mansion grounds,
<0069> \ We are planning to harvest cherries.
<0070> \{[Rei]}
<0071> "I see... Well, the weather is nice, so why not take a walk?
<0072> \ I'll go and see how you do your job."
<0073> \{[Rei]}
<0074> "It might help kill some time."
<0075> \{[Mari]}
<0076> "Is that so...!
<0077> \ At this time of year, it is a good idea to take a walk to the orchard.
<0078> \ Might be good!
<0079> \{[Mari]}
<0080> "The broom flowers are in full bloom in that area right now.
<0081> \ There are lots of them in bloom."
<0082> \{[Rei]}
<0083> "Broom...?
<0084> \ That's a flower name I've never heard of before."
<0085> \{[Mari]}
<0086> "It originates from Europe, but on the grounds of this museum,
<0087> \ There are a lot of them planted."
<0088> \{[Mari]}
<0089> "It's a golden flower with a wonderful fragrance,
<0090> \ I think you'll understand right away."
<0091> After breakfast, as Rei had told Marie,
<0092> I went to the orchard.
<0093> Just as Marie said, along this road that I don't usually go,
<0094> Something that Rei hadn't seen much of before.
<0095> Golden flowers - broom bushes stretch on and on.
<0096> The flowers seemed to be in full bloom now.
<0097> A unique sweet and refreshing scent fills the air.
<0098> When you inhale the scent of this flower,
<0099> My spirits strangely become more upbeatーor so I think.
<0100> That's what I feel when I'm with Marie.
<0101> It was very similar to that impression, that lightened my heart.
<0102> After walking for a while,
<0103> Finally, I see what appears to be the entrance to the orchard.
<0104> There was a shrub with branches laden with red berries,
<0105> There are several lined up.
<0106> In one of them, I spotted Marie.
<0107> \{[Rei]}
<0108> "Mari..."
<0109> \{[Mari]}
<0110> "Well, Rei-sama. Have you finished your walk yet?"
<0111> \{[Rei]}
<0112> "Yes... It looks like the harvest is progressing."
<0113> \{[Mari]}
<0114> "Yes! Now is the best time."
<0115> \{[Mari]}
<0116> "Cherries are delicious just as they are, but
<0117> \ It's also a useful ingredient for making sweets."
<0118> Inside the basket Marie was carrying,
<0119> The carefully picked cherries are shining bright red.
<0120> \{[Mari]}
<0121> "It looks just like a red jewel..."
<0122> \{[Mari]}
<0123> "The freshly picked fruit is sweet and sour and refreshing,
<0124> \ It's really delicious."
<0125> \{[Mari]}
<0126> "I'll serve it as dessert with today's lunch too!"
<0127> \{[Rei]}
<0128> "Yes, that's fun."
<0129> \{[Mari]}
<0130> "Next time, I'll try cherry pie!
<0131> \ ...Ah, oh!"
<0132> While talking with Rei,
<0133> Marie was about to pick some fruit from the upper branches,
<0134> It seems like it's just a little out of reach.
<0135> \{[Mari]}
<0136> "I should have brought a stepladder today.
<0137> \ The fruit at the top,
<0138> \ They're so ripe and delicious..."
<0139> Marie muttered in disappointment.
<0140> Pick up Marie
<0141> Do nothing
<0142> Suddenly, Rei felt mischievous.
<0143> I went behind Marie, who was looking up at the branches above,
<0144> He casually picked up her small body.
<0145> \{[Mari]}
<0146> "Kyaaa...!?"
<0147> Perhaps he was surprised by the sudden change in his line of sight.
<0148> Marie becomes flustered and turns bright red.
<0149> \{[Rei]}
<0150> "Look, now you can reach it."
<0151> \{[Mari]}
<0152> "Wha-what...?!"
<0153> \{[Mari]}
<0154> "Rei-sama, this...!"
<0155> \{[Rei]}
<0156> "What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?"
<0157> \{[Mari]}
<0158> "No! I can't do this,
<0159> \ I can't let you do this to Rei-sama...!"
<0160> \{[Rei]}
<0161> "I'm fine."
<0162> \{[Mari]}
<0163> "Um, I'm heavy...!"
<0164> \{[Rei]}
<0165> "That's not true. You're light... like a little bird.
<0166> \ Are you the one who eats properly every day?
<0167> \{[Mari]}
<0168> "Kya...!"
<0169> \{[Mari]}
<0170> "Um... well, then, I'll take you up on your offer,
<0171> \ Only the fruit of this branch,
<0172> \ I'll pick it for you..."
<0173> Marie's blushing and flustered face made me laugh,
<0174> Until Marie finishes the harvest,
<0175> The smile on Rei's face never faded.
<0176> \{[Rei]}
<0177> "...Well, I'll be back soon."
<0178> \{[Mari]}
<0179> "Yes! Then I'll continue working."
<0180> \{[Mari]}
<0181> "The weather is nice today,
<0182> \ Please continue,
<0183> \ Please enjoy your walk slowly.
<0184> After leaving Marie's place,
<0185> The time until lunch,
<0186> Rei spent the time leisurely strolling around the grounds.
<0187> Spend a pleasant morning strolling through the orchard,
<0188> It's almost lunchtime.
<0189> After lunch, Rei returned to her room and enjoyed reading for a while,
<0190> I left the room to change my mood.
<0191> I went down to the garden looking for Marie,
<0192> I sat in the comfortable shade of a tree, the sunlight filtering through the trees.
<0193> I find Marie's back.
<0194> \{[Rei]}
<0195> "Mari, what are you doing here?"
<0196> \{[Mari]}
<0197> "Please be quiet, Rei-sama."
<0198> \{[Rei]}
<0199> "Oh, this is..."
<0200> I whisper softly,
<0201> I put my head on Marie's lap,
<0202> Nozomi is asleep with a completely safe and defenseless face.
<0203> \{[Mari]}
<0204> "Nozomi, you seem a little tired.
<0205> \ I've been completely absent..."
<0206> \{[Rei]}
<0207> "It seems like he's become quite attached to you.
<0208> \ Seeing this child so at ease,
<0209> \ This might be the first time.
<0210> \{[Mari]}
<0211> "Talking with you is so much fun.
<0212> \ I wonder what it would be like if I had a younger brother."
<0213> \{[Rei]}
<0214> "Mari..."
<0215> As the words suggest, it's like a kind older sister watching over her younger brother.
<0216> With a gaze full of compassion and love,
<0217> Marie looks down on Nozomi like a parent bird protecting her sleep.
<0218> The dazzling light-filled scene, like a painting,
<0219> Rei narrowed her eyes and stared.
<0220> You'll want to stare at it forever.
<0221> The peaceful and warm view,
<0222> Rei watched quietly, making sure no one broke it.
<0223> Afterwards, Rei was relaxing in her room,
<0224> I enjoyed reading.
<0225> Before we knew it, dusk had fallen,
<0226> Following Marie's invitation, I head to the restaurant.
<0227> \{[Mari]}
<0228> "Oh? Rei-sama, there's more than usual today.
<0229> \ You're eating it."
<0230> \{[Rei]}
<0231> "...Maybe it's because I've been going out in the morning lately,
<0232> \ I have a better appetite than before.
<0233> \{[Rei]}
<0234> "Everything tastes better than before."
<0235> \{[Mari]}
<0236> "That's a good thing...!
<0237> \ These days, I too have been hearing Rei-sama's voice,
<0238> \ I felt like it was brighter than before.
<0239> \{[Mari]}
<0240> "When you walk outside on a nice day,
<0241> \ Apparently it's good for your health... Maybe that's why."
<0242> \{[Mari]}
<0243> "Appropriate exercise is important after all!"
<0244> \{[Mari]}
<0245> "Reading is good, but if you balance it with exercise,
<0246> \ I think it's good for your health too...!"
<0247> I'll listen to your advice.
<0248> Say nothing
<0249> \{[Rei]}
<0250> "...I understand. I'll listen to your advice."
<0251> \{[Mari]}
<0252> "Yes...!"
<0253> \{[Mari]}
<0254> "Um... thank you very much."
<0255> \{[Rei]}
<0256> "By the way, Marie. Do you like to read books?"
<0257> \{[Mari]}
<0258> "A book?"
<0259> \{[Mari]}
<0260> "Yes, I love it!
<0261> \ I read a lot as a child.
<0262> \{[Rei]}
<0263> "Yes. As you can see,
<0264> \ I enjoy reading when I have free time.
<0265> \{[Rei]}
<0266> "But recently, the books in this room alone aren't enough.
<0267> \ It's starting to feel unsatisfying..."
<0268> \{[Rei]}
<0269> "It occurred to me that this mansion might have something like a library.
<0270> \ Don't you know?
<0271> \{[Mari]}
<0272> "...the library...?"
<0273> \{[Mari]}
<0274> "There used to be a large library in this building,
<0275> \ About half a year ago, the books in the archives
<0276> \ It seems they've all been moved somewhere."
<0277> \{[Mari]}
<0278> "All that's left is an empty bookshelf."
<0279> \{[Rei]}
<0280> "I see..."
<0281> \{[Mari]}
<0282> "Ah, but I have one idea."
<0283> \{[Mari]}
<0284> "But, that place,
<0285> \ It's a restricted area..."
<0286> \{[Mari]}
<0287> "There's an old library in the attic of the mansion."
<0288> \{[Mari]}
<0289> "Currently, entry is prohibited,
<0290> \ The floors and stairs are solid,
<0291> \ I think it's okay to come and go!
<0292> \{[Rei]}
<0293> "The attic library... sounds interesting.
<0294> \ I'd like to see what kind of books they have."
<0295> \{[Rei]}
<0296> "Maybe I'll go after dinner.
<0297> \ Marie, can you show me to the attic?
<0298> \{[Mari]}
<0299> "Yes! With pleasure."
<0300> After dinner that night,
<0301> Rei headed to the archives with Marie's guidance.
<0302> \{[Mari]}
<0303> "Rei-sama, the archives are this way."
<0304> \{[Rei]}
<0305> "Is this it...?"
<0306> \{[Rei]}
<0307> "I'm sure I've seen this before..."
<0308> \{[Rei]}
<0309> "This is the first time I've seen this place..."
<0310> Marie took the lead,
<0311> I climb the stairs with light steps.
<0312> I pushed aside the partition that was blocking the passageway to the landing,
<0313> I pass through the gap and look back at Rei.
<0314> \{[Mari]}
<0315> "You can get through from here."
<0316> Rei followed close behind Marie, passing by the screen,
<0317> Head further up.
<0318> When you reach the top of the stairs, there is a large landing and
<0319> A corridor stretches out further into the distance.
<0320> Suddenly, Rei felt like she had seen this scene somewhere before.
<0321> \{[Rei]}
<0322> "...where...?"
<0323> \{[Mari]}
<0324> "Rei-sama...?"
<0325> \{[Rei]}
<0326> "Ahh, sorry. I was just thinking about something.
<0327> \ Where is the archives?
<0328> \{[Mari]}
<0329> "This way."
<0330> Along the wall of the hallway,
<0331> I can see a row of doors.
<0332> Among them, Marie
<0333> I put my hand on the knob of the particularly large door,
<0334> It opened slowly.
<0335> \{[Rei]}
<0336> "This room really does have a vintage feel to it."
<0337> \{[Mari]}
<0338> "Apparently, this was the library of the previous owner of this mansion.
<0339> \ The old books and belongings remain intact.
<0340> Rei walked over to the bookshelf,
<0341> I looked at the spines of the old books lined up there.
<0342> \{[Rei]}
<0343> "...This is certainly a valuable collection.
<0344> \ There are a lot of old books here.
<0345> \{[Rei]}
<0346> "The period seems to be...mostly from the early Showa period."
<0347> Rei muttered as she checked the books on the bookshelf.
<0348> \{[Rei]}
<0349> "But why is this place...
<0350> \ I guess it's off-limits?"
<0351> \{[Rei]}
<0352> "It's a rare book,
<0353> \ It would be good to put it to good use."
<0354> \{[Mari]}
<0355> "...I wonder why. From what I've heard,
<0356> \ When the Kujo family bought this place,
<0357> \ Apparently this attic is haunted.
<0358> \{[Mari]}
<0359> "So no one can enter here,
<0360> \ Apparently his belongings have been left as they are."
<0361> \{[Mari]}
<0362> "I often go to this attic,
<0363> \ I'm coming to clean up,
<0364> \ Everyone else is scared and won't come near me."
<0365> \{[Rei]}
<0366> "So... are you okay?"
<0367> \{[Mari]}
<0368> "Yes! I'm fine."
<0369> \{[Mari]}
<0370> "I've got this attic,
<0371> \ I love cleaning the mansion..."
<0372> \{[Rei]}
<0373> "I see. If I've seen, heard, and confirmed it myself,
<0374> \ I don't mind.
<0375> \{[Rei]}
<0376> "There's nothing unpleasant about this place."
<0377> \{[Mari]}
<0378> "Is that so...!
<0379> \ Well, I'm glad I showed you here!
<0380> \{[Mari]}
<0381> "The current owner of the mansion is Lady Rei,
<0382> \ You may come and go here whenever you like,
<0383> \ I think it'll be fine."
<0384> \{[Rei]}
<0385> "I see... Then let me see the book right away."
<0386> \{[Mari]}
<0387> "Yes! Well, I'll be off now.
<0388> \ Please call me whenever you need anything."
<0389> Leaving a satisfied smile behind,
<0390> Marie left the attic library.
<0391> Rei, who was left behind, picked out the book whose spine caught her eye,
<0392> I was absorbed in reading a book, following my interest.
<0393> ……………………………
<0394> …………………
<0395> ………
<0396> When I realized it, it was past midnight.
<0397> \{[Rei]}
<0398> (...It's already late tonight.
<0399> \ I'll read the rest tomorrow.)
<0400> Having made that decision, I quietly closed the book,
<0401> Rei returned to her room and soon fell asleep.
