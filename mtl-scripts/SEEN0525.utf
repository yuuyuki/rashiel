#character '[? ]'

<0000> He exhaled with relief, a breath mixed with blood.
<0001> Lying on his back, defenseless against the hard ground,
<0002> Takami was staring blankly up at the sky.
<0003> Slowly, from your feet towards the direction above your head,
<0004> The sky is clear with white clouds drifting by.
<0005> The sky is high, blue and far away,
<0006> It stretches as if there is no end.
<0007> The blue sky is so pleasantly clear,
<0008> The forest with birds chirping is so peaceful and beautiful.
<0009> ...But still.
<0010> Takami is alone,
<0011> He was about to meet a lonely end.
<0012> \{[Takami]}
<0013> (...No one here...)
<0014> Leaving his father at the mansion, who showed little interest in his son,
<0015> When was it that I stepped into the nearby forest alone?
<0016> While chasing a butterfly, he slipped and fell off a cliff.
<0017> It was a long time ago.
<0018> When I fell from a great height and hit my back hard,
<0019> I felt an unpleasant sensation, like something was breaking.
<0020> By the time I realized it, my nerves had already been damaged.
<0021> My hands and feet were completely numb, and I couldn't even move a single finger.
<0022> I can't move properly and can't confirm it,
<0023> In areas important for maintaining life,
<0024> I was clearly aware that I had suffered a fatal injury.
<0025> Without suffering or pain, but certainly,
<0026> Little by little, something important is lost from within.
<0027> Only the feeling of that irreparable loss
<0028> It was the only sensation Takami had left.
<0029> \{[Takami]}
<0030> (I wonder if I'm going to die here...)
<0031> Not feeling pain is a relief at least.
<0032> However, because of this, I was unable to lose consciousness first,
<0033> The cold fingertips that are about to take me to the world of death,
<0034> It was painful to be made aware that my life was being wasted.
<0035> Looking up, the sky is endlessly high and blue.
<0036> Alone like this, facing death,
<0037> Without anyone to watch over him,
<0038> I feel awfully miserable just lying on the ground.
<0039> \{[Takami]}
<0040> "...Who is it...?"
<0041> Please find me,
<0042> With heartbreaking sadness,
<0043> Takami prayed to the heavens -- and then...
<0044> \{[? ]}
<0045> "...Don't you want to die?"
<0046> The words reached Takami's heart, which was almost filled with despair.
<0047> A childish whisper with a clear voice.
<0048> In front of the gaze that was closing weakly,
<0049> Suddenly, with the blue sky as a backdrop, it came into view,
<0050> A dazzling presence that reflects light.
<0051> A dazzling presence,
<0052> Takami's gaze is captured along with his heart.
<0053> \{[Takami]}
<0054> "Ah..."
<0055> In an upside-down world painted in two colors, blue and white,
<0056> What suddenly peeked into Takami's face was,
<0057> A clear, intelligent gaze higher than the sky, filled with curiosity.
<0058> Hair that is light in color and translucent in the light.
<0059> Depending on the amount of light that shines in,
<0060> The colors appear different in dark blue, cyan, and violet.
<0061> Intelligent eyes with a mysterious color like a cat's.
<0062> Looking closely, I saw a face that was much younger than Takami's.
<0063> She was so beautiful, like a doll,
<0064> Takami couldn't help but hold his breath and stare.
<0065> \{[Takami]}
<0066> (An angel has come to pick me up...?)
<0067> In the display room of the mansion, where rare books and art objects collected by his father are lined up,
<0068> Takami has been let through several times.
<0069> What is displayed there is,
<0070> Items related to angels collected from both the East and the West,
<0071> Takami was exposed to his father's hobbies from an early age,
<0072> I decided to grow up.
<0073> And then, at some point, Takami,
<0074> Although this feeling was cultivated through the influence of his father,
<0075> To the otherworldly beings known as angels,
<0076> I began to feel a childlike longing.
<0077> I saw an angel in an illustration in an old Western book on a shelf.
<0078> If we were to give it a shape in the real world,
<0079> It must look something like this.
<0080> With the face he had imagined right in front of him, Takami
<0081> I was sure my prayers to the heavens would be answered.
<0082> He thought an angel had come to fetch him.
<0083> \{[Takami]}
<0084> (What... If an angel like this comes to pick me up,
<0085> \ I hope it's not so lonely...)
<0086> Before he knew it, Takami had forgotten the sadness and despair he had felt just a moment ago.
<0087> He was smiling at the little angel.
<0088> The smile of a child on the brink of death
<0089> At first, the angel blinked in confusion,
<0090> Soon he returns the goofy smile to Takami.
<0091> \{[Takami]}
<0092> (That made me laugh...!)
<0093> It's like a flower blooming and light spilling out.
<0094> You will be captivated by it.
<0095> It was a smile that made me want to keep looking at it forever.
<0096> \{[Takami]}
<0097> (If I die here, this angel's smiling face will also
<0098> \ I wonder if I'll never see it again...)
<0099> I don't know what the afterlife is like,
<0100> Just like this, I let myself be slowly enveloped in a lethargic feeling.
<0101> Once you close your heavy eyelids...
<0102> I feel like I'll never see that smile again.
<0103> \{[Takami]}
<0104> (That's... I don't want that!
<0105> I... don't want to die yet...!)
<0106> The desire for life increases.
<0107> \{[? ]}
<0108> "You don't want to die...?"
<0109> \{[Takami]}
<0110> "...Yes. I want to live..."
<0111> \{[? ]}
<0112> "Then I'll lend you my strength..."
<0113> \{[Takami]}
<0114> "--Me, you say?!"
<0115> More than the angel saying, "I'll lend you my strength,"
<0116> An angel who believed there was no gender,
<0117> He is surprised when she calls him "I" and his eyes widen.
<0118> \{[Takami]}
<0119> "Eh..."
<0120> The angel's face moves closer.
<0121> Takami was so surprised that he closed his eyes,
<0122> Something warm and soft touched me softly,
<0123> I knew I had been kissed by an angel.
<0124> In my panic, my lips started to part,
<0125> A small tongue was inserted and gently touched Takami's tongue.
<0126> Although I was confused by this new experience,
<0127> The tip of Takami's tongue was enveloped in an indescribable comfort.
<0128> A soft, sweet sigh was heard.
<0129> \{[Takami]}
<0130> (……!)
<0131> Through our touching tongues,
<0132> It's like a torrent of light is pouring in.
<0133> It's like being enveloped in a dazzling glow.
<0134> A strange sensation fills my whole body.
<0135> \{[Takami]}
<0136> (...Ah, how warm...)
<0137> --When I came to, I found myself deep in a quiet forest with no sign of people.
<0138> Directly beneath the high cliff,
<0139> Lying on my back, looking up at the sky,
<0140> Takami was alone.
<0141> The blue sky is endlessly far and high,
<0142> It's so clear it seems like there's no end to it.
<0143> The chirps of birds echoed cheerfully through the green forest,
<0144> The world is filled with gentle light.
<0145> Takami, who should have faced death, had not a single scratch on his body.
<0146> Takami's arms and legs now move exactly as he wants them to.
<0147> --But the angel is nowhere to be seen.
<0148> It was as if the series of events that Takami encountered
<0149> As if it were a daydream in the middle of the day,
<0150> Nothing seems to have changed in the world around Takami.
<0151> But――
<0152> \{[Takami]}
<0153> "...It's not a dream."
<0154> The angel who had touched Takami so gently left behind
<0155> Delivered to the lips and deeper,
<0156> I recall the feeling of that sweet kiss.
<0157> And then, the meeting just now was not a dream.
<0158> Deepen your conviction.
<0159> \{[Takami]}
<0160> "I wonder if we'll meet again..."
<0161> Is there a chance that Takami will meet that angel again?
<0162> I am not a god, so I have no way of knowing,
<0163> That was why Takami prayed so earnestly.
<0164> A reunion with that angel,
<0165> I wished so strongly...
