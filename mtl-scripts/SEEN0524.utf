<0000> Suddenly, I sensed someone nearby and opened my eyes,
<0001> My bangs are so close that they almost touch.
<0002> A face more familiar than anyone else looked down at Rei from directly above.
<0003> \{［伶］}
<0004> "...Takami?"
<0005> My gaze met his, peering intently.
<0006> Why is Takami's face so close?
<0007> Rei mutters the name in wonder.
<0008> \{[Takami]}
<0009> "...! Rei! Are you awake?"
<0010> With such force that it seemed as if he was about to jump up,
<0011> Takami, his face bright red and flustered, steps back.
<0012> I jumped back in a panic,
<0013> Takami makes a spectacular slip.
<0014> \{［伶］}
<0015> "...What are you doing?
<0016> \ Are you doing that on purpose to make me laugh?
<0017> \{[Takami]}
<0018> "That can't be true!"
<0019> \{［伶］}
<0020> "...Takami? Why are you here?
<0021> \ When did you come here?
<0022> \{[Takami]}
<0023> "...It's nine o'clock."
<0024> \{［伶］}
<0025> "Okay. So, what time is it?"
<0026> \{[Takami]}
<0027> "………………
<0028> \ …………
<0029> \ ...After 11 o'clock."
<0030> \{［伶］}
<0031> "...Well, if you came so early,
<0032> \ Why didn't you wake me up right away?
<0033> \{[Takami]}
<0034> "That... that's..."
<0035> \{［伶］}
<0036> "You seem to have a lot of free time on your hands.
<0037> \ --Don't you have that much to do?"
<0038> \{[Takami]}
<0039> "Don't talk about people like they're retired old people!
<0040> \ I'm busy, but I'm taking the time to
<0041> \ I came to see you!?
<0042> \{[Takami]}
<0043> "You're always like that!
<0044> \ Please be a little grateful to me, or give me a compliment,
<0045> \ Even if you show such a noble attitude..."
<0046> \{[Takami]}
<0047> "...Hey, are you listening, Rei?"
<0048> \{［伶］}
<0049> "...just to meet me,
<0050> \ Did you just drop your work and come here?
<0051> \ Saying you're busy?
<0052> \{[Takami]}
<0053> "...! No, that's..."
<0054> \{［伶］}
<0055> "And for two hours you
<0056> \ Just sitting there blankly,
<0057> \ You were looking at my sleeping face."
<0058> \{[Takami]}
<0059> "...Uh..."
<0060> \{［伶］}
<0061> "Takami. Let me say something.
<0062> \ You really are..."
<0063> \{［伶］}
<0064> "...What an idiot."
<0065> \{[Takami]}
<0066> "Ugh, shut up!"
<0067> \{［伶］}
<0068> "Haha, that looks like you're thinking the same thing yourself.
<0069> I know I was doing something stupid."
<0070> \{[Takami]}
<0071> "--That's enough, I'm going home!
<0072> \ Sorry for bothering you when I had no business with you!
<0073> \{[Takami]}
<0074> "Hmm, you look so comfortable sleeping,
<0075> \ I was worried about waking him up,
<0076> \ This is it...!
<0077> \{［伶］}
<0078> "Oh, sorry I teased you.
<0079> \ You've come all the way here, so don't go home yet.
<0080> \{［伶］}
<0081> "Obviously, you're going to have lunch soon, right?
<0082> \ If you're okay with it, would you like to have dinner with me?
<0083> \{[Takami]}
<0084> "...with you?"
<0085> \{［伶］}
<0086> "Yes. Just me and me."
<0087> \{［伶］}
<0088> "As an apology for laughing, for the dessert at lunch,
<0089> \ I'll have it served with your favorite peach mousse.
<0090> \ Why don't we do something about it?"
<0091> \{［伶］}
<0092> "Hey, Takamiーwhat should we do?"
<0093> \{[Takami]}
<0094> "…………
<0095> \ ...eat."
<0096> \{［伶］}
<0097> "Well, that's settled. Now, about lunch,
<0098> \ Could you please tell Marie?
<0099> \{[Takami]}
<0100> "Hey! You're still as rough as ever!"
<0101> \{[Takami]}
<0102> "Really?! You said you were sorry, but...
<0103> \ If you let me give you orders,
<0104> \ That's not an apology... Wait, hey!?
<0105> \{［伶］}
<0106> "...? What's wrong, why are you making such a strange face?
<0107> \ Was there something on my back?
<0108> \ That's strange, nothing happened in the shower last night."
<0109> \{[Takami]}
<0110> "No, that's not it, that's not it...!"
<0111> \{[Takami]}
<0112> "Hey, Rei! Don't just take off your clothes in front of other people!
<0113> \ ...Whoa!?
<0114> \ Idiot, don't look at me dressed like that...!"
<0115> \{［伶］}
<0116> "...Hey, Takami. Why are you panicking?
<0117> \ Even though they're both guys, they just change clothes."
<0118> \{[Takami]}
<0119> "...No, that's..."
<0120> \{［伶］}
<0121> "......"
<0122> \{[Takami]}
<0123> "......"
<0124> \{［伶］}
<0125> "...Takami, can I get changed?"
<0126> \{[Takami]}
<0127> "--I'll go tell Marie about lunch!
<0128> \ See you soon!
<0129> Takami turned away with a bright red face and declared loudly,
<0130> He ran out of the room like a rabbit.
<0131> \{［伶］}
<0132> "...What a strange guy."
<0133> Takami left the room in a panic.
<0134> Rei was stunned and saw them off.
<0135> I struggled to contain the laughter that was gradually building up inside me.
<0136> I slowly changed my clothes.
<0137> Looking up at the bright, clear sky,
<0138> With the warm, soft early summer sunlight hitting my whole body,
<0139> Morning, my hair rustling in the green-scented breeze.
<0140> On that day, Rei stood shoulder to shoulder with Takami,
<0141> Beneath the clear, refreshing blue sky,
<0142> I stood there in silence.
<0143> \{［伶］}
<0144> "...Indeed, the wind is calm today and the air is warm.
<0145> \ It's the perfect weather to go outside.
<0146> \{[Takami]}
<0147> "...Ahh..."
<0148> \{［伶］}
<0149> "So, having a meal on the breezy terrace is
<0150> \ I think it certainly feels good.
<0151> \{[Takami]}
<0152> "...You're right. I think so too..."
<0153> \{［伶］}
<0154> "But even so,
<0155> \ There's no reason to set it up like this, right?
<0156> \{[Takami]}
<0157> "......"
<0158> \{［伶］}
<0159> "...What exactly are you planning, Takami?"
<0160> \{［伶］}
<0161> "Two grown men,
<0162> \ Eating something like this while facing each other in harmony,
<0163> \ I think it's quite embarrassing.
<0164> \{[Takami]}
<0165> "......"
<0166> On the terrace of the mansion facing the lush garden,
<0167> Antique table sets made of plain wood are lined up,
<0168> Lunch for two is set on the table.
<0169> It smells delicious like butter,
<0170> Steaming hot freshly baked rolls,
<0171> Freshly delivered cheese from the farm,
<0172> Fresh sour cream.
<0173> Using the harvests from the various fields,
<0174> The red and yellow colors are also vividly arranged.
<0175> Warm vegetable salad.
<0176> Boiled black pork sausage with mustard,
<0177> Roast beef with special sauce,
<0178> The dish is beautifully decorated with vegetables seasoned with wine vinegar.
<0179> Wrapped in gorgeous colors and a sweet and sour, fragrant aroma,
<0180> A variety of mouthwatering dishes,
<0181> At first glance, the table setting appears flawless.
<0182> Rei and the others are welcomed.
<0183> However, the problem isーthe corner of the table where the food is located,
<0184> It was on a large plate with a certain dish on it.
<0185> With a somewhat bewildered expression,
<0186> What Takami was staring down at was,
<0187> Perhaps it was prepared as a dessert.
<0188> A homemade cake decorated with strawberries and cream.
<0189> If it were an ordinary cake,
<0190> Neither Rei nor Takami had ever been more confused.
<0191> Yes - normally.
<0192> Rei stared intently at the cake on the plate,
<0193> I couldn't help but mutter to Takami.
<0194> \{［伶］}
<0195> "It's certainly a unique decoration... I think.
<0196> \ But, with heart-shaped chocolates and a shared umbrella,
<0197> \ Isn't it a little too innovative to include our names?
<0198> \{[Takami]}
<0199> "......"
<0200> On top of the cake covered in pure white cream,
<0201> It is beautifully decorated,
<0202> Thinly rolled heart-shaped chocolate.
<0203> The letters written on the surface with a white chocolate pen are
<0204> "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" and
<0205> "MERRY CHRISTMAS"---
<0206> It is usually a general expression of congratulations.
<0207> However, the words written on the heart-shaped chocolate,
<0208> They lined up together under a shared umbrella,
<0209> "TAKAMI" and "REI"
<0210> How should we interpret it if it is the name of two men?
<0211> \{［伶］}
<0212> "It's like a girly charm...
<0213> \ That's a pretty unusual topping.
<0214> \ Was this cake decorated as per your instructions?
<0215> \{［伶］}
<0216> "I can't believe you went to the trouble of preparing a dessert like this.
<0217> \ Your tastes are quite profound..."
<0218> \{[Takami]}
<0219> "N-No! That wasn't my order, absolutely not!
<0220> \ Don't make such a silly mistake, Rei!
<0221> \ I wasn't the one who prepared this!
<0222> \{[Takami]}
<0223> "It's Marie! It's Marie's doing...!
<0224> \ If I let him prepare lunch,
<0225> \ He even prepared something like this for me!
<0226> \{[Takami]}
<0227> "Rei, I want to make sure you don't get the wrong idea.
<0228> I, in this girly situation,
<0229> \ It's not like I was longing for it!
<0230> \{［伶］}
<0231> "Well... I'm sorry for being rude.
<0232> \ Everyone has their own tastes and preferences.
<0233> \ I'm not going to say anything about your tastes anymore.
<0234> \{[Takami]}
<0235> "You, you bastard!
<0236> \ You know everything, and yet...!
<0237> \{[Mari]}
<0238> "Oh? Both of you,
<0239> \ What is all the fuss about?"
<0240> \{[Takami]}
<0241> "Hey, Marie!
<0242> \ What are you trying to do, you idiot? Explain!
<0243> Just in time,
<0244> Marie was pushing a cart bringing in hot food.
<0245> Takami approaches with loud footsteps.
<0246> \{[Mari]}
<0247> "Um, what exactly are you asking about?
<0248> \ How was the food?
<0249> \{[Takami]}
<0250> "Whatever happens, it happens!
<0251> \ What is this cake?
<0252> \ What were you thinking when you prepared something like this!?
<0253> \{[Mari]}
<0254> "Is this it? This is the friendship between you two.
<0255> \ I hope this continues forever,
<0256> \ I prepared this gift with prayers in mind..."
<0257> \{[Mari]}
<0258> "Um, is there a problem...?"
<0259> \{[Takami]}
<0260> "Problems? Seriously!"
<0261> \{[Takami]}
<0262> "Why would two men put their names on a shared umbrella?
<0263> \ You must do something fruitless!
<0264> This is not what you would call "friendship"!
<0265> \{[Mari]}
<0266> "Huh? Was there something strange?
<0267> \ Sharing an umbrella is a sign of wishing for good relations,
<0268> \ That's what I heard..."
<0269> \{[Takami]}
<0270> "No! That's a love story between a man and a woman,
<0271> \ Definitely not something to use to pray for friendship between two guys!"
<0272> \{[Takami]}
<0273> "This is like we're
<0274> \ It makes us look like we're lovers!
<0275> \{[Mari]}
<0276> "Oh, oh? Is that so?
<0277> \ Looks like I was mistaken!
<0278> \ I'm sorry..."
<0279> \{[Takami]}
<0280> "Using a person's name,
<0281> \ Don't do anything complicated that could lead to misunderstandings!
<0282> \ Really..."
<0283> \{[Mari]}
<0284> "Um, I'll take the cake away now."
<0285> \{［伶］}
<0286> "Wait. There's no need to lower it in a hurry.
<0287> \ It's a product that was made for our good.
<0288> \ I'll be grateful."
<0289> \{［伶］}
<0290> "Come on, Takami. Don't be so embarrassed and swear.
<0291> \ Let's have some cake together.
<0292> I hope our friendship continues...
<0293> \{[Takami]}
<0294> "I'm not angry to hide my embarrassment!
<0295> \ You're harassing me like that again..."
<0296> \{［伶］}
<0297> "Well, that's fine, Takami.
<0298> \ Marie did it purely out of kindness.
<0299> \ I didn't mean any harm."
<0300> \{［伶］}
<0301> "Regardless of the content of the decorations,
<0302> \ This is an elaborate and delicious looking cake.
<0303> \ There's nothing to waste.
<0304> \{［伶］}
<0305> "Mari, I'll have it with tea after dinner,
<0306> \ Cut the cake later."
<0307> \{[Mari]}
<0308> "Yes...!"
<0309> \{［伶］}
<0310> "--Ah, that's right. For Takami,
<0311> \ We put our names on the shared umbrella,
<0312> \ Put this chocolate on it."
<0313> \{[Takami]}
<0314> "Hey, Rei! You're...!"
<0315> Even with Rei's light teasing words,
<0316> Takami's attitude of reacting seriously to everything and fluctuating between joy and sorrow,
<0317> Rei finally couldn't contain herself and laughed out loud.
<0318> \{[Takami]}
<0319> “Rei…”
<0320> It was a rare sight for Rei to show such unguarded emotion,
<0321> Takami stares at Rei with a look of extreme surprise on his face.
<0322> Rei's carefree attitude made me
<0323> Takami soon gave up on trying to scold him and let out a wry smile.
<0324> \{[Mari]}
<0325> "Well, in order to ensure that both of you get a fair share,
<0326> \ This umbrella chocolate,
<0327> \ Shall I hurry up and prepare another one?
<0328> \{[Takami]}
<0329> "No, that's enough...!"
<0330> An unexpectedly peaceful and harmonious dining scene.
<0331> On the terrace overlooking the green garden,
<0332> The event unfolded in a relaxed and peaceful manner.
<0333> The food on the table,
<0334> About the care of the flowers and trees blooming in the garden,
<0335> There is no hint or probing,
<0336> Rei truly enjoyed the casual conversation with Takami.
<0337> We finished our meal in cheerful conversation,
<0338> The peach mousse I requested for today's dessert was also delicious.
<0339> Marie also decorated the cake with her unique style.
<0340> The two of us finished it all.
<0341> Just before Marie started preparing to make tea,
<0342> Takami, who had won the fight, glanced at me and said,
<0343> He asked Rei with a somewhat embarrassed look on his face.
<0344> \{[Takami]}
<0345> "...If you want, I'm feeling a little better today,
<0346> \ I can make you some tea.
<0347> I'm sure there was a complete set of Chinese tea utensils left behind by my father in this mansion too."
<0348> \{[Takami]}
<0349> "Would you like to drink the tea I made...?"
<0350> I want to drink
<0351> No need
<0352> \{［伶］}
<0353> "This is a rare and precious opportunity,
<0354> \ There's no reason for me to refuse. I'll be happy to accept it.
<0355> \{[Takami]}
<0356> "I see. Well then, please wait a moment.
<0357> \ I'll have the tools ready right away."
<0358> \{[Takami]}
<0359> "The newly acquired tea leaves are stored in the annex,
<0360> \ I should have brought it here.
<0361> \ It has a deep flavor that is different from the leaves from the other day.
<0362> \{[Takami]}
<0363> "It has a unique flavor that's a bit strong,
<0364> \ Some people find it difficult,
<0365> I'm sure you'll understand its merits..."
<0366> \{[Takami]}
<0367> "...Hey. What's wrong, Rei?"
<0368> \{［伶］}
<0369> "You're talking to me about your hobbies so happily,
<0370> \ I think this is a situation that would have been unthinkable just a short while ago.
<0371> \ It feels a bit ticklish.
<0372> \{[Takami]}
<0373> "...Now that you mention it, that's true.
<0374> \ I never thought the day would come when I would spend time with you like this,
<0375> \ I never thought of it.
<0376> \{[Takami]}
<0377> "Iーwell, I don't think this is so bad,
<0378> \ What about you...?
<0379> \{［伶］}
<0380> "I'm just like you.
<0381> \ It's not bad to have a gentle conversation with you."
<0382> \{[Takami]}
<0383> "I, I see..."
<0384> By skillfully using the set of tea utensils prepared,
<0385> Takami skillfully brewed hot, fragrant tea,
<0386> He serves it to Rei on a tea tray.
<0387> \{[Takami]}
<0388> "...How's it going?"
<0389> \{［伶］}
<0390> "Yes. It smells good.
<0391> \ The leaves have opened just right and are very tasty.
<0392> \ Your skills are as good as ever.
<0393> \{[Takami]}
<0394> "Of course. We have different years of experience."
<0395> \{[Takami]}
<0396> "...Come to think of it,
<0397> \ I started to hone my skills in brewing Chinese tea,
<0398> \ You were the catalyst."
<0399> \{［伶］}
<0400> "Me? ...That's rather surprising.
<0401> \ Maybe it's because I praised the tea you made?
<0402> \{[Takami]}
<0403> "No, that's not it."
<0404> \{［伶］}
<0405> "So what's the reason?"
<0406> \{[Takami]}
<0407> "You were terrible at making tea.
<0408> \ It was catastrophically bad.
<0409> \{［伶］}
<0410> "...!"
<0411> \{[Takami]}
<0412> "You were also taught by your father in the past.
<0413> \ But I didn't improve at all,
<0414> \ I know that in the end, my father gave up.
<0415> \{［伶］}
<0416> "......"
<0417> \{[Takami]}
<0418> "It's frustrating, but by studying and using my brain,
<0419> \ I have never been able to beat you.
<0420> \ But I'm definitely better at this one!"
<0421> \{[Takami]}
<0422> "...From the moment I realized that,
<0423> \ At first, I was reluctant to do it because my father was forcing me to do it.
<0424> \ Before I knew it, I was hooked.
<0425> \{[Takami]}
<0426> "And then, before I knew it, I had become very good at making tea.
<0427> \ He had become quite a person...
<0428> \{［伶］}
<0429> "I never thought you'd have such a motive..."
<0430> \{[Takami]}
<0431> "You always have a cold expression on your face,
<0432> \ The only time she shows a relaxed expression is when she drinks my tea,
<0433> \ That was one of my motives..."
<0434> \{［伶］}
<0435> "Takami, did you say something?"
<0436> \{[Takami]}
<0437> "No, nothing! Nothing!"
<0438> \{［伶］}
<0439> "...?"
<0440> \{[Takami]}
<0441> "But you, who can do anything with such a cool face,
<0442> \ I didn't think you were that clumsy.
<0443> \{［伶］}
<0444> "...Even I have my weaknesses."
<0445> \{[Takami]}
<0446> "Indeed. You are perfect in terms of knowledge and theory,
<0447> \ It was terrible in practice.
<0448> \ ...Only cooking and other things related to daily life."
<0449> \{［伶］}
<0450> "Regarding that,
<0451> \ You can't really say much about other people, can you?
<0452> \{[Takami]}
<0453> "But mine's not as good as yours."
<0454> \{［伶］}
<0455> "......"
<0456> \{[Takami]}
<0457> "Now that I think about it, someone with as little ability to make a living as you,
<0458> \ I'm amazed that you managed to live alone for two years.
<0459> \ How did you live?
<0460> \{[Takami]}
<0461> "Your clothes and your house were always neat and clean,
<0462> \ That's why I don't think you did it."
<0463> \{［伶］}
<0464> "...the people he prepared,
<0465> \ To use them as servants,
<0466> \ It was one of the conditions for me to leave Kujo's residence."
<0467> \{[Takami]}
<0468> "--My father?"
<0469> \{［伶］}
<0470> "Because of these circumstances,
<0471> \ Meals, cleaning, and other tedious chores around the house,
<0472> \ I left everything to the servants who came and went.
<0473> \{[Takami]}
<0474> "...My father gave you those conditions..."
<0475> \{［伶］}
<0476> "Just by accepting those conditions,
<0477> \ I didn't think I'd be allowed to leave the house,
<0478> \ It was lucky for me."
<0479> \{［伶］}
<0480> "But, a year before that person died,
<0481> \ He dismissed the servants he had employed up until then,
<0482> \ We also replaced all the people coming in and out.
<0483> \{[Takami]}
<0484> "...I see. With my father's death,
<0485> \ So you have finally achieved true freedom."
<0486> \{［伶］}
<0487> "It's not that big of a deal.
<0488> \ However, I always feel like I'm tied down.
<0489> That vague feeling of suffocation has completely faded away.
<0490> \{[Takami]}
<0491> "Completely away from my father's supervision,
<0492> \ I'm sure you're feeling a lot better now, too.
<0493> \{［伶］}
<0494> "Well, I wonder."
<0495> \{［伶］}
<0496> "Speaking of freedom, boarding school was great."
<0497> \{［伶］}
<0498> "If you enroll me in a boarding school for boys,
<0499> \ To be honest, I was surprised because it was him who made that decision.
<0500> \ I never thought you would let me out of the mansion on your own.
<0501> \{[Takami]}
<0502> "...I later learned the details,
<0503> \ Apparently there were some problems within the Kujo family at that time.
<0504> \ The situation surrounding my father seems to have been quite unsettling.
<0505> \{[Takami]}
<0506> "To keep you safe, my father isolated you from the mansion.
<0507> \ They sent you off to the boarding school--"
<0508> \{［伶］}
<0509> "...Right. The reason why they sent me to the boarding school was,
<0510> \ So that's what happened."
<0511> \{［伶］}
<0512> "I didn't know about the family dispute,
<0513> \ At that time, I was just being honest.
<0514> \ I was enjoying the freedom I had unexpectedly gained."
<0515> \{［伶］}
<0516> "No, no need. I'm fine with the tea."
<0517> \{[Takami]}
<0518> "I see..."
<0519> \{［伶］}
<0520> "...Come to think of it, this morning, for the first time in a while,
<0521> \ I had a dream about my days in boarding school.
<0522> \ This is the dream I had about the day you asked me about losing my tie pin.
<0523> \{［伶］}
<0524> "It was just a small incident that happened in everyday life.
<0525> \ I'm sure you don't remember, but..."
<0526> \{[Takami]}
<0527> "No... I remember it well."
<0528> \{［伶］}
<0529> "Really? But then,
<0530> \ Until I told you how I got that tie pin back.
<0531> \ Surely even you don't know?
<0532> \{[Takami]}
<0533> "......"
<0534> \{［伶］}
<0535> "After that, this happened--"
<0536> Back then, all the students living together in the dormitory
<0537> Each person was given a room,
<0538> There he was to spend some personal time.
<0539> On the day I lost my tie pin,
<0540> Rei spends a night in the private room she was given, just like any other night.
<0541> And so, the morning arrived, just like any other.
<0542> The only thing that was different from usual was,
<0543> When Rei woke up and looked out the window,
<0544> There was a small silver item there, shining in the morning sun.
<0545> \{［伶］}
<0546> "This...can it be...mine?"
<0547> It was something that Rei had completely given up on getting back.
<0548> It was that silver tie pin.
<0549> \{［伶］}
<0550> "Why is this here...?"
<0551> I picked it up and checked, but the tie pin,
<0552> There is not a scratch or even a cloudiness on the surface.
<0553> It had been carefully polished and cared for.
<0554> I don't know who put this there,
<0555> It is certain that the boy who stole this was not the work of himself.
<0556> People who dislike Rei and harass her,
<0557> It was obvious that it had been treated with such care.
<0558> There's no way they'd just give back what they took.
<0559> \{［伶］}
<0560> "Who could it be...?"
<0561> I had given up on the idea that I would ever get my hands on this thing again.
<0562> One of the few items that contains memories of Rei.
<0563> Without even saying a word to Rei about the memorable item,
<0564> The person who retrieved it, quietly placed it on the windowsill, and left.
<0565> This selfless act that person did for Rei,
<0566> Like a gentle breeze blowing across the surface of a frozen lake,
<0567> A thought crossed my mind as I gently touched the hard-armored surface of Rei's heart.
<0568> \{［伶］}
<0569> "That was... a special memory."
<0570> \{［伶］}
<0571> "If you don't worry about what you've lost,
<0572> \ I thought so myself,
<0573> \ I was unexpectedly happy that someone had returned it to me."
<0574> \{［伶］}
<0575> "I wasn't really aware of it,
<0576> \ I treasured it much more than I thought,
<0577> \ It was only then that I realized--"
<0578> \{［伶］}
<0579> "The person who returned my tie pin was
<0580> \ The fact that I had unconsciously treasured that thing,
<0581> \ Maybe he noticed."
<0582> \{[Takami]}
<0583> "......"
<0584> \{［伶］}
<0585> "If that's really the case, it's quite strange.
<0586> \ About the feelings that I didn't even realize myself,
<0587> \ I can't believe someone knew about it before me."
<0588> \{［伶］}
<0589> "In the end, who gave me my tie pin back?
<0590> \ I didn't understand until the end,
<0591> \ Perhaps you could have become friends with that person."
<0592> \{［伶］}
<0593> "When I think about it like that, I feel like I missed out somehow."
<0594> \{[Takami]}
<0595> "......"
<0596> \{［伶］}
<0597> "The one who did that to me was
<0598> \ Who on earth was that――」
<0599> \{[Takami]}
<0600> "......"
<0601> \{［伶］}
<0602> "...What's wrong, Takami?
<0603> \ You've been quiet and looking down for a while now.
<0604> \{[Takami]}
<0605> "You're such a bad guy...!"
<0606> \{[Takami]}
<0607> "I should be able to think faster than most people,
<0608> \ You're still as strangely slow as ever when it comes to things like that...!"
<0609> \{［伶］}
<0610> "...What does that mean?"
<0611> \{[Takami]}
<0612> "That's... me."
<0613> \{［伶］}
<0614> "Huh?"
<0615> \{[Takami]}
<0616> "I got my tie pin back from the guy who stole it,
<0617> \ I'm the one who gave it back to you."
<0618> \{[Takami]}
<0619> "That was a gift from his mother to her son,
<0620> \ It's my last birthday present,
<0621> \ I remembered what you said when I first put it on..."
<0622> \{［伶］}
<0623> "Takami..."
<0624> As Takami said,
<0625> The silver tie pin that Rei wore when she was a student,
<0626> It was a gift that Rei's mother gave to her when she was six years old.
<0627> Before my mother became afraid of Rei,
<0628> Given as a birthday present,
<0629> A gentle and last memento that connects mother and Rei.
<0630> "Giving something like this to a child like you...
<0631> I know it's a bit premature, but...
<0632> Saying this with a shy smile,
<0633> I handed Rei a small box wrapped in beautiful paper and ribbon.
<0634> I can still vividly remember my mother's smile.
<0635> When you open the box, you will find a handwritten message card,
<0636> The motif is a dove holding an ear of wheat in its beak.
<0637> A stylishly designed pure silver tie pin appears.
<0638> This brought a sign of peace to the earth on the ark,
<0639> \ I made it with the image of a pigeon in mind.
<0640> "I hope Rei will be happy..."
<0641> \ The design you chose with your wishes in mind,
<0642> \ I had it made into a tie pin.
<0643> “Next year, the year after that, and every year,
<0644> \ I'll give you a new present for your birthday..."
<0645> The promise conveyed by a delicate smile,
<0646> However, he was never protected again.
<0647> Since the year when I first became aware of Rei's power,
<0648> Rei's mother no longer celebrates her birthday.
<0649> In the end, the silver tie pin given to me on my sixth birthday,
<0650> This turned out to be my mother's final gift.
<0651> "I'm always a short-tempered mother, but please forgive me.
<0652> \ Rei, I love you.
<0653> The message card with the words from my mother was,
<0654> I burned it and threw it away when I left home.
<0655> The reason I didn't throw away the tie pin was because
<0656> I decided that it would be useful in the future,
<0657> If you think about it,
<0658> Maybe it's just an excuse not to throw it away.
<0659> It was the person who made me realize this small thought.
<0660> The memento that was once lost from Rei's hands,
<0661> Soon it was restored by the actions of a kind-hearted person,
<0662> It was all thanks to a series of events.
<0663> The person who gave me fond memories,
<0664> The fact that it was Takami,
<0665> First I was astonished - then I was delighted,
<0666> Rei smiled slowly.
<0667> \{［伶］}
<0668> "I see... that was you..."
<0669> \{［伶］}
<0670> "Yes, it's obvious if you think about it.
<0671> \ How valuable that is to me,
<0672> \ Only you, who knows the circumstances surrounding its gift, can understand that.
<0673> \{［伶］}
<0674> "To those who don't know the situation,
<0675> \ It's nothing more than a fancy decoration.
<0676> \ I would have lost it without you."
<0677> \{［伶］}
<0678> "You and I were always at odds whenever we met,
<0679> \ I never even considered that possibility.
<0680> \ Takami, I'm sorry I didn't notice until now.
<0681> \{[Takami]}
<0682> "No... I don't really..."
<0683> \{［伶］}
<0684> "Thank you... I'm truly grateful."
<0685> \{[Takami]}
<0686> "Anyway, it looks like there's a bit of a breeze!
<0687> \ Shouldn't we go into the room now?
<0688> \{［伶］}
<0689> "That's right, let's call it a day.
<0690> \ -- I'll tell you the rest in my room."
<0691> \{[Takami]}
<0692> "Continue...?!"
<0693> \{［伶］}
<0694> "You've supported me like this,
<0695> \ Isn't this going to be more than just this one incident?
<0696> \{[Takami]}
<0697> "That...that's it!"
<0698> \{［伶］}
<0699> "The person who had been harassing me since that day,
<0700> \ When she saw my face, she quickly looked away,
<0701> \ I've started sneaking around and hiding..."
<0702> \{［伶］}
<0703> "Do you have any idea about that matter?"
<0704> \{[Takami]}
<0705> "...No, I..."
<0706> \{［伶］}
<0707> "Including that,
<0708> \ I'd like you to talk about your memories of those days in detail.
<0709> \ I'd like to hear more about it.
<0710> \{[Takami]}
<0711> "...Ugh..."
<0712> \{［伶］}
<0713> "There's still time, right?
<0714> \ In that case, you should take it easy for a while."
<0715> \{［伶］}
<0716> "Yes - the things I couldn't talk about back then,
<0717> \ Let's talk slowly..."
<0718> \{[Takami]}
<0719> “…Rei…”
<0720> \{[Takami]}
<0721> "Ah - that's right.
<0722> \ I have plenty of time to talk to you.
<0723> \ Let's have a long talk..."
<0724> Squinting in the dazzling early summer sunlight,
<0725> I looked at Rei with a bit of dazzle,
<0726> Takami answered with an embarrassed smile.
